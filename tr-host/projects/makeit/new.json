Beykpour and Bernstein came up with the idea for Periscope while traveling abroad in 2013. Beykpour was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He wanted to see what was happening there, so he turned to Twitter. While he could read about the protests, he could not see them. They started the company in February 2014, under the name Bounty. They raised $1.5 million from Founder Collective, Scott Belsky, Maveron, Google Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Bessemer, Stanford – StartX and Sam Shank in April 2014. Periscope was acquired January 2015 by Twitter before the product had been publicly launched. One investor source says the acquisition amount was \"sizeable\", above $50 million. Another says it fell between $75 and $100 million. A third says the deal was \"small-ish\". The acquisition was officially announced in a tweet from Periscope and retweeted by Twitter CEO Dick Costolo on March 13 after the rival video streaming app Meerkat was a breakout hit at South by Southwest 2015 (March 13-17). Meerkat became the talk of SXSW partially due to Twitter cutting Meerkat off from its social graph just as the festival was starting. Periscope was launched on March 26, 2015. Later, on May 26, 2015, Periscope was released for Android. On August 12, 2015, it was announced that Periscope had surpassed 10 million accounts, just four months after it was launched. It was noted that over 40 years of video was being watched per day. On December 9, 2015, Apple named Periscope as the iPhone App of the Year. Periscope was featured on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" with Kayvon Beykpour as a guest on December 18, 2015. In addition to sharing the inspiration for Periscope, its sale history included meeting Periscope's mission, which was to get it into as many hands as possible, thus Twitter. Beykpour gave Colbert a one-on-one tutorial, which was recorded live then edited for its showing three hours later."

IFTTT was created by Linden Tibbets, Jesse Tane, Scott Tong and Alexander Tibbets in San Francisco, California. IFTTT was launched in September 7, 2011. Today, IFTTT recipes are widely used and shared by its users. In addition to its web-based application, IFTTT for iPhone was launched on July 10, 2013 and contained three channels: iOS Photos, Reminders and Contacts. An iPad version with iOS notification support was later introduced on April 3, 2014. Later that month, on April 24, 2014, IFTTT released an Android version of the app. On February 19, 2015, IFTTT renamed their original application to IF and released a new suite of apps called Do. The Do apps allow users to create customizable shortcut applications and actions. Linden Tibbets also announced that IFTTT users are now \"cooking\" about 20 million \"recipes\" each day."

It formerly had been a very popular social news website, allowing people to vote web content up or down, called digging and burying, respectively. Quantcast had estimated Digg's monthly U.S. unique visits at 3.8 million. Digg's popularity prompted the creation of similar social networking sites with story submission and voting systems such as Reddit. In July 2008, the former company took part in advanced acquisition talks with Google for a reported $200 million price tag, but the deal ultimately fell through. After a controversial 2010 redesign and the departure of co-founders Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, in July 2012 Digg was sold in three parts: the Digg brand, website and technology were sold to the current owner, Betaworks, for an estimated $500,000; 15 staff were transferred to the Washington Post's \"SocialCode\" for a reported $12 million; and a suite of patents were sold to LinkedIn for about $4 million.",

The project proved successful, raising US$2.5 million from the campaign for the development of the product. In March 2014, Facebook purchased Oculus for $2 billion. The Rift has gone through various pre-production models since the Kickstarter campaign, around five of which were demonstrated to the public. Two of these models were shipped to backers, labelled as 'development kits'; the DK1 in mid 2013 and DK2 in mid 2014, to give developers a chance to develop content on time for the Rift's release. However, both were also purchased by a large number of enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology. The Rift has an OLED display, 1080×1200 resolution per eye, a 90 Hz refresh rate, and 110° field of view. It has integrated headphones which provide a 3D audio effect, rotational and positional tracking. The positional tracking system, called \"Constellation\", is performed by a USB stationary infrared sensor that is picking up light that is emitted by IR LEDs that are integrated into the hmd. The sensor normally sits on the user's desk. This creates 3D space, allowing for the user to use the Rift while sitting, standing, or walking around the same room."

It was introduced at the Google I/O 2014 developers conference, where a Cardboard viewer was given away to all attendees. The Cardboard software development kit (SDK) is available for the Android and iOS operating systems; the SDK's VR View allows developers to embed VR content on the web as well as in their mobile apps. Through January 2016, over 5 million Cardboard viewers had shipped and over 1,000 compatible applications had been published. Following the success of the Cardboard platform, Google announced an enhanced VR platform, Daydream, at Google I/O 2016.",

The Gear VR headset also includes a touchpad and back button on the side, as well as a proximity sensor to detect when the headset is on. The touchpad and button allow for a standard minimum input capability for users to interact with the virtual environments, whereas Google Cardboard devices only feature a button. The Gear VR was first announced in September 2014. To allow developers to create content for the Gear VR and to allow VR and technology enthusiasts to get early access to the technology, Samsung had released two innovator editions of the Gear VR before the consumer version."

The technology was developed by S. Scott Crump in the late 1980s and was commercialized in 1990. The term fused deposition modeling and its abbreviation to FDM are trademarked by Stratasys Inc. The exactly equivalent term, fused filament fabrication (FFF), was coined by the members of the RepRap project to give a phrase that would be legally unconstrained in its use. It is also sometimes called Plastic Jet Printing (PJP).",

Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language. However, the identification and recognition of posture, gait, proxemics, and human behaviors is also the subject of gesture recognition techniques.Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUIs (graphical user interfaces), which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse. Gesture recognition enables humans to communicate with the machine (HMI) and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. Using the concept of gesture recognition, it is possible to point a finger at the computer screen so that the cursor will move accordingly. This could potentially make conventional input devices such as mouse, keyboards and even touch-screens redundant. Gesture Recognition Features: \n* More Accurate  \n* High Stability The major application areas of gesture recognition in the current scenario are: \n* Automotive sector \n* Consumer Electronics sector \n* Transit sector \n* Gaming sector Gesture recognition can be conducted with techniques from computer vision and image processing. The literature includes ongoing work in the computer vision field on capturing gestures or more general human pose and movements by cameras connected to a computer. Gesture recognition and pen computing:Pen computing reduces the hardware impact of a system and also increases the range of physical world objects usable for control beyond traditional digital objects like keyboards and mice. Such implementations could enable a new range of hardware that does not require monitors. This idea may lead to the creation of holographic display. The term gesture recognition has been used to refer more narrowly to non-text-input handwriting symbols, such as inking on a graphics tablet, multi-touch gestures, and mouse gesture recognition. This is computer interaction through the drawing of symbols with a pointing device cursor. (see Pen computing)",

SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of all leading enterprise software companies.[citation needed] One of the biggest selling points for these companies is the potential to reduce IT support costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the SaaS provider.[citation needed] According to a Gartner Group estimate, SaaS sales in 2010 reached $10 billion, and were projected to increase to $12.1bn in 2011, up 20.7% from 2010. Gartner Group estimates that SaaS revenue will be more than double its 2010 numbers by 2015 and reach a projected $21.3bn. Customer relationship management (CRM) continues to be the largest market for SaaS. SaaS revenue within the CRM market was forecast to reach $3.8bn in 2011, up from $3.2bn in 2010. The term \"software as a service\" (SaaS) is considered to be part of the nomenclature of cloud computing, along with infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), desktop as a service (DaaS), managed software as a service (MSaaS), mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), and information technology management as a service (ITMaaS).",

Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources, and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, yet that are beneficial to all the peers. While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains, the architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster, originally released in 1999. The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts, peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society, enabled by Internet technologies in general.",

        "abstract": "Fog computing or fog networking, also known as fogging, is an architecture that uses one or a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of storage (rather than stored primarily in cloud data centers), communication (rather than routed over the internet backbone), and control, configuration, measurement and management (rather than controlled primarily by network gateways such as those in the LTE (telecommunication) core). Fog computing can be perceived both in large cloud systems and big data structures, making reference to the growing difficulties in accessing information objectively. This results in a lack of quality of the obtained content. The effects of fog computing on cloud computing and big data systems may vary; yet, a common aspect that can be extracted is a limitation in accurate content distribution, an issue that has been tackled with the creation of metrics that attempt to improve accuracy. Fog networking consists of a control plane and a data plane. For example, on the data plane, fog computing enables computing services to reside at the edge of the network as opposed to servers in a data-center. Compared to cloud computing, fog computing emphasizes proximity to end-users and client objectives, dense geographical distribution and local resource pooling, latency reduction for quality of service (QoS) and edge analytics/stream mining, resulting in superior user-experience and redundancy in case of failure. Fog networking supports the Internet of Everything (IoE), in which most of the devices that we use on a daily basis will be connected to each other. Examples include our phones, wearable health monitoring devices, connected vehicle and augmented reality using devices such as the Google Glass. ISO/IEC 20248 provides a method whereby the data of objects identified by edge computing using Automated Identification Data Carriers [AIDC], a barcode and/or RFID tag, can be read, interpreted, verified and made available into the \"Fog\" and on the \"Edge\" even when the AIDC tag has moved on.",

As a result, lenders often earn higher returns compared to savings and investment products offered by banks, while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates, even after the P2P lending company has taken a fee for providing the match-making platform and credit checking the borrower. Also known as crowdlending, many peer-to-peer loans are unsecured personal loans, though some of the largest amounts are lent to businesses. Secured loans are sometimes offered by using luxury assets such as jewelry, watches, vintage cars, fine art, buildings, aircraft and other business assets as collateral. They are made to an individual, company or charity. Other forms of peer-to-peer lending include student loans, commercial and real estate loans, payday loans, as well as secured business loans, leasing and factoring. The interest rates can be set by lenders who compete for the lowest rate on the reverse auction model, or fixed by the intermediary company on the basis of an analysis of the borrower's credit. The lender's investment in the loan is not normally protected by any government guarantee. On some services, lenders mitigate the risk of bad debt by choosing which borrowers to lend to, and mitigate total risk by diversifying their investments among different borrowers. Other models involve the P2P lending company maintaining a separate, ringfenced fund, such as RateSetter's Provision Fund, which pays lenders back in the event the borrower defaults. Bankruptcy of the peer-to-peer lending company that facilitated the loan may also put a lender's investment at risk, as has happened in 2015 in the case of TrustBuddy. The lending intermediaries are for-profit businesses; they generate revenue by collecting a one-time fee on funded loans from borrowers and by assessing a loan servicing fee to investors (tax-disadvantaged in the UK vs charging borrowers) or borrowers (either a fixed amount annually or a percentage of the loan amount). Compared to stock markets, peer-to-peer lending tends to have both less volatility and less liquidity."

It is also known as \"automatic speech recognition\" (ASR), \"computer speech recognition\", or just \"speech to text\" (STT). Some SR systems use \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \"speaker independent\" systems. Systems that use training are called \"speaker dependent\". Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. \"Call home\"), call routing (e.g. \"I would like to make a collect call\"), domotic appliance control, search (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed Direct Voice Input). The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process. From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the world-wide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems. These speech industry players include Google, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Baidu (China), Apple, Amazon, Nuance, IflyTek (China), many of which have publicized the core technology in their speech recognition systems as being based on deep learning.",

From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and in general, deal with the extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems. Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, object pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, and image restoration.",

The defining functional effect of these technical approaches is that predictive analytics provides a predictive score (probability) for each individual (customer, employee, healthcare patient, product SKU, vehicle, component, machine, or other organizational unit) in order to determine, inform, or influence organizational processes that pertain across large numbers of individuals, such as in marketing, credit risk assessment, fraud detection, manufacturing, healthcare, and government operations including law enforcement. Predictive analytics is used in actuarial science, marketing, financial services, insurance, telecommunications, retail, travel, healthcare, child protection, pharmaceuticals, capacity planning and other fields. One of the most well known applications is credit scoring, which is used throughout financial services.

Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting - such as sales, marketing, operations, and finance - uses this type of post-mortem analysis. The next phase is predictive analytics. Predictive analytics answers the question what is likely to happen. This is when historical data is combined with rules, algorithms, and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring. The final phase is prescriptive analytics, which goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option. This is not correct. Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities. All three phases of analytics can be performed through professional services or technology or a combination. In order to scale, prescriptive analytics technologies need to be adaptive to take into account the growing volume, velocity, and variety of data that most mission critical processes and their environments may produce. One criticism of prescriptive analytics is that its distinction from predictive analytics is ill-defined and therefore ill-conceived.",

It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining, where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning. Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics.

A distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to  peer-to-peer applications. A computer program that runs in a distributed system is called a distributed program, and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs. There are many alternatives for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues. A goal and challenge pursued by some computer scientists and practitioners in distributed systems is location transparency; however, this goal has fallen out of favour in industry, as distributed systems are different from conventional non-distributed systems, and the differences, such as network partitions, partial system failures, and partial upgrades, cannot simply be \"papered over\" by attempts at \"transparency\" (see CAP theorem). Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, which communicate with each other by message passing.",

In some fields these time series are called profiles, curves, or traces. A time series of stock prices might be called a price curve. A time series of energy consumption might be called a load profile. A log of temperature values over time might be called a temperature trace. Despite the disparate names, many of the same mathematical operations, queries, or database transactions are useful for analysing all of them. The implementation of a database that can correctly, reliably, and efficiently implement these operations must be specialized for time-series data. TSDBs are databases that are optimized for time series data. Software with complex logic or business rules and high transaction volume for time series data may not be practical with traditional relational database management systems. Flat file databases are not a viable option either, if the data and transaction volume reaches a maximum threshold determined by the capacity of individual servers (processing power and storage capacity). Queries for historical data, replete with time ranges and roll ups and arbitrary time zone conversions are difficult in a relational database. Compositions of those rules are even more difficult. This is a problem compounded by the free nature of relational systems themselves. Many relational systems are often not modelled correctly with respect to time series data. TSDBs on the other hand impose a model and this allows them to provide more features for doing so. Ideally, these repositories are often natively implemented using specialized database algorithms. However, it is possible to store time series as binary large objects (BLOBs) in a relational database or by using a VLDB approach coupled with a pure star schema. Efficiency is often improved if time is treated as a discrete quantity rather than as a continuous mathematical dimension. Database joins across multiple time series data sets is only practical when the time tag associated with each data entry spans the same set of discrete times for all data sets across which the join is performed.",

ZigBee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking (ZigBee networks are secured by 128 bit symmetric encryption keys.) ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device. ZigBee was conceived in 1998, standardized in 2003, and revised in 2006.

AI research is highly technical and specialized, and is deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. Some of the division is due to social and cultural factors: subfields have grown up around particular institutions and the work of individual researchers. AI research is also divided by several technical issues. Some subfields focus on the solution of specific . Others focus on one of several possible or on the use of a particular or towards the accomplishment of particular . The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence is still among the field's long-term goals. Currently popular approaches include , and . There are a large number of tools used in AI, including versions of , , , and many others. The AI field is interdisciplinary, in which a number of sciences and professions converge, including computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neuroscience, as well as other specialized fields such as artificial psychology. The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, human intelligence—the sapience of Homo sapiens sapiens—\"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\" This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues which have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.

Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual[citation needed], occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject. More recently, \"multi-author blogs\" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other \"microblogging\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into societal newstreams. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog. The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users. (Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and FTP had been required to publish content on the Web.) A majority are interactive, allowing visitors to leave comments and even message each other via GUI widgets on the blogs, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites. In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also build social relations with their readers and other bloggers. However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments, such as Daring Fireball. Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries; others function more as online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, Web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or \"vlogs\"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts. In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources. These blogs are referred to as edublogs. On 16 February 2011, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence. On 20 February 2014, there were around 172 million Tumblr and 75.8 million WordPress blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and other bloggers, Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today. However, Blogger does not offer public statistics. Technorati has 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.",

The verb \"to stream\" refers to the process of delivering media in this manner; the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself, and is an alternative to downloading. A client media player can begin to play the data (such as a movie) before the entire file has been transmitted. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television) or inherently nonstreaming (e.g. books, video cassettes, audio CDs). For example, in the 1930s, elevator music was among the earliest popularly available streaming media; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media. The term \"streaming media\" can apply to media other than video and audio such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which are all considered \"streaming text\". The term \"streaming\" was first used in the early 1990s as a better description for video on demand on IP networks; at the time such video was usually referred to as \"store and forward video\", which was misleading nomenclature. Live streaming, which refers to content delivered live over the Internet, requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content.",

        "abstract": "A podcast is a form of digital media that consists of an episodic series of audio, video, digital radio, PDF, or ePub files subscribed to and downloaded through web syndication or streamed online to a computer or mobile device. The word is a portmanteau of \"(i)Pod\" and \"broadcast.\" The Merriam Webster Tenth International Collegiate defines \"podcast\" as: a program (as of music or talk) made available in digital format for automatic download over the Internet. A podcast's distributor maintains a list of audio or video files in a series on a server as a web feed, and the listener or viewer uses special client application software, known as a podcatcher, to access this web feed, check it for updates, and download any new files in the series. This process can be automated so that new files are downloaded automatically, which may seem to the user as if the content is being broadcast or \"pushed\" to them. Files are stored locally on the user's computer or other device, ready for offline use. Podcasting contrasts with webcasting (Internet streaming), which generally isn't designed for offline listening to user-selected content. As discussed by Richard Berry, podcasting is both a converged medium bringing together audio, the web, and portable media player, and a disruptive technology that has caused some in the radio business to reconsider established practices and preconceptions about audiences, consumption, production, and distribution. This is largely because no one person owns the technology; it is free to listen and create content, which departs from the traditional model of \"gate-kept\" media and production tools. It is very much a horizontal media form: producers are consumers and consumers become producers and engage in conversations with each other.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) typically refers to computer technologies that use software to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that replicate a real environment (or create an imaginary setting), and simulate a user's physical presence in this environment, by enabling the user to interact with this space and any objects depicted therein using specialized display screens or projectors and other devices. VR has been defined as \"...a realistic and immersive simulation of a three-dimensional environment, created using interactive software and hardware, and experienced or controlled by movement of the body\" or as an \"immersive, interactive experience generated by a computer\". A person using virtual reality equipment is typically able to \"look around\" the artificial world, move about in it and interact with features or items that are depicted on a screen or in goggles. Virtual realities artificially create sensory experiences, which can include sight, touch, hearing, and, less commonly, smell. Most 2016-era virtual realities are displayed either on a computer monitor, a projector screen, or with a virtual reality headset (also called head-mounted display or HMD). HMDs typically take the form of head-mounted goggles with a screen in front of the eyes. Some simulations include additional sensory information and provide sounds through speakers or headphones.Virtual Reality actually brings the user into the digital world by cutting off outside stimuli. In this way user is solely focusing on the digital content. Some advanced haptic systems in the 2010s now include tactile information, generally known as force feedback in medical, video gaming and military training applications. Some VR systems used in video games can transmit vibrations and other sensations to the user via the game controller. Virtual reality also refers to remote communication environments which provide a virtual presence of users with through telepresence and telexistence or the use of a virtual artifact (VA), either through the use of standard input devices such as a keyboard and mouse, or through multimodal devices such as a wired glove or omnidirectional treadmills. The immersive environment can be similar to the real world in order to create a lifelike experience—for example, in simulations for pilot or combat training, which depict realistic images and sounds of the world, where the normal laws of physics apply (e.g., in flight simulators), or it can differ significantly from reality, such as in VR video games that take place in fantasy settings, where gamers can use fictional magic and telekinesis powers.",

Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world. This information can be virtual or real, e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio waves overlaid in exact alignment with where they actually are in space.Augmented reality basically brings out the components of the Digital world into our perceived Real world.

Futurologists such as Jeremy Rifkin believe that 3D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution, succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century. Using the power of the Internet, it may eventually be possible to send a blueprint of any product to any place in the world to be replicated by a 3D printer with \"elemental inks\" capable of being combined into any material substance of any desired form. 3D printing in the term's original sense refers to processes that sequentially deposit material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads. More recently, the meaning of the term has expanded to encompass a wider variety of techniques such as extrusion and sintering-based processes. Technical standards generally use the term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.",

      "Name": "Desktop manufacturing",
      "Description": "# Desktop Manufacturing\r\nDesktop Manufacturing relates to machines usually associated with size ranging from a normal inkjet 2D-printer to maximum 1x1x1 meter and with a price range from 0–5000 €. However, sometimes the production depends on further processes in additional machines, which in total does not fit the desktop anymore. This size of machines is available for most digital tools for manufacturing like 3D printing, Laser cutting and CNC routing. \r\n\r\nFor some makers and enterprises the ideal machine is reliable and cannot be fiddled with, a so-called out-of-the-box machine (3D printers like UP3D UP Plus 2 and CraftUnique CraftBot – see picture below) and for others, it needs to be completely open and adjustable in any way – even by building it themselves like the RepRap. This printer is a low \r\n\r\nbudget project for the real hardware-software enthusiast. The idea is to make a machine that can reproduce itself. All brackets and joints have been printed with another 3D-printer. It comes in many shapes and sizes. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"../img/details/desktop1.jpg\" style=\"width:80%\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../img/details/desktop2.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n## Gap is closing in the years to come \r\nThe gap between more expensive machines for manufacturing and cheaper desktop models is closing. Part quality regarding surface finish, mechanical properties, resolution and reliability of the printer is equal to many of the bigger and professional machines within many technologies like laser cutters and 3D printers like FDM and SLA technologies. “In the next year or so, competition between desktop 3D printers and industrial systems will increase as the capabilities of the desktop systems continue to grow”5 E.g. we already see printers in this market with features to recognise the material and adjust the print settings automatically. \r\n\r\nThe key enabler for making these machines attractive for makers and small enterprises is the low price range compared to larger and more professional systems. Even though the technology is not on the same level, in many cases it does not justify the 90 times higher price on professional systems.6  \r\n\r\nAnother advantage making these machines attractive for enterprises is the wide range of materials available on the market. With the number of machines manufacturers exploding the recent years, so is material manufacturers. For the “open” desktop 3D printers, material is actually available that is not yet available for the “closed” professional machines, e.g. soft TPU, metal filled, metal clay, conductive and biodegradable filament. In Wholers report Joris Peels estimate that filament developers and manufacturers could drive the desktop market growth, as they develop material the industrial end users needs. \r\n\r\n## Known technology will be cheap and at desktop size \r\nStratasys’ patent on FDM printing opened in 2009 and since then the market have flooded with FDM-printers. Just recently, the patents on Laser sintering (SLS) and Stereolithography (SLA) opened, so these technologies will soon be available on “low budget”. \r\n\r\nThis SLS technology is widely used in the enterprise market (print services). These is due to good mechanical properties of the parts. The downside is poor surface roughness due to powder materials. The powder material causes an issue with material handling, when it comes to makers and consumers, as it needs to be handled with personal protection equipment. These machines are already available in desktop size but the price is not below 5000 Euro yet, though this is expected to happen within five years or so. \r\n\r\nPlastic printers will be more reliable, have slightly better detail and finish, but will also print in several materials in one printer. The materials will be more advances, making it possible to print electrical circuits and combine the materials e.g. rubber-like and rigid plastic. Few machines already have the ability to print a continuous fibre reinforcement into the print, increasing the strength and stiffness several times, addressing the issue with poor mechanical properties in FDM parts. This is likely to pick up, when consumers adapt to the technology and find more \r\n\r\napplications to this. When more technologies have accessed the consumer market, new exciting materials will follow e.g. Metals and ceramics in liquid SLA material.7 \r\n\r\nIn approximately five years, ongoing projects about extruding metals with a desktop printer will be finished. June 2016 a metal printer (aluminium) with droplets had its debut. In the beginning, this will only be available for the enterprise. Other projects related to this, e.g. using electroplating techniques for printing will also be close to market techniques for printing will also be close to market. \r\n\r\n## Machines are getting smaller and smarter \r\nBetter, cheaper and more reliable machines will make digital manufacturing more popular in general in all markets; maker, consumer and enterprise. This will accelerate product development8 and lead to greater mass customisation and distributed manufacturing \r\n\r\nThis could eventually lead to more home manufacturing and thus to more “makers”. Later on, these makers will be “ordinary” end users - without the thinking of maker movement but home manufacturing could be as natural as shopping (you shop online and print it yourself). \r\n\r\nTechnologies for 3D-printing which will access the market for makers in few years, like SLA and Poly-jetting (both light polymerization) is now suitable for enterprises. In order to prepare it for hobbyist, issues about material handling must be taken care of. Very fine powder from the SLS and the toxic epoxy liquid from SLA can cause health damage if it is not suitable handled. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"../img/details/desktop2.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n## From a makers perspective\r\nThe increase in numbers of cheap FDM printers, laser cutters and even CNC routers on the market have facilitated huge growth in the maker movement. More technologies that are available, opening up to an even wider range of materials (different surface finishes and mechanical properties) and new design freedom will lead to continues exponential growth9 in the maker movement. \r\n\r\nWhen all these machines becomes better and smarter and one does not need to be a real “tinkerer” or even have technical insight. \r\n\r\n## From a consumer perspective\r\nFor every day consumers the machine will only be useful when it is completely reliable and only the material needs to be refilled. By now, it is completely applicable in homes for making small gadgets with very easy to use machines. When it comes to ease of use machines, the collaboration between Microsoft and MakerBot10 serves a good example on how machines for home manufacturing will soon be “plug and print”, as we are all used to when printing out a document.  \r\n\r\nOne way, this user group is already in contact with the new technology, is through educational systems. One of the largest markets for desktop machines is believed to be in educational institutions.11 3D-printing and other digital tools for manufacturing is already a permanent piece of equipment in the workshop at some public schools and most \r\n\r\nschools for higher education. Here it facilitates better understanding and acquire skills when teaching STEM12 13 (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics). \r\n\r\nEventually this will also lead to more advanced parts in every home. \r\n\r\n## From an enterprise perspective \r\nThis will accelerate with designers increased awareness of the new possibilities with digital tooling – facilitated by. \r\n\r\nEven though it is believed that hundreds of companies produce desktop 3d-printers in this low price range, the majority ends up in enterprises, perhaps as many as 65-75%. Engineering departments and designers have been the largest users.14 Like stated before, this will speed up the pace which products are being developed when small manufacturing machines is wide spread in all engineering departments 15 and make products better and smart with the bigger freedom of design that comes with digital tools for manufacturing. Even though the small desktop machines technology wise will still lag behind larger professional machines at the current time, this trend will by time facilitate, that designers and engineers, will design each product smarter (e.g. more efficient or have tweaked mechanical properties like damping) and consist of fewer parts. E.g. vital and compact parts in high performance applications like turbine engines.16 ",

      "Description": "# Personalized manufacturing\nWhen the end customer is either changing design by choosing a different color, typing a text or designing them-self a product better suiting their needs, they become the co-creator along with original designers. This is already possible on one of the biggest print service platforms like [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/create).Here, one can also upload the new design and let other buy their design in just a few hours, making it very easy for a consumer to shift to designer and entrepreneur very fast. Another approach to personalised manufacturing is either to design your piece in a software intended for your purpose and ask for a price of manufacturing on a network like [3D-hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/).\n\n## New possibilities but not just perfect\nThis is already happening, but elements that slows things down is e.g. the range of materials and surface quality. Especially the surface finish of 3D printed parts is - without post processing – still far from conventional manufactured parts. Another thing that could slow things down is the resistance from established companies with violated intellectual properties on designs being shared on [file repositories](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/01/17/3d-printers-will-soon-change-the-world-if-its-not-strangled-in-a-lawyered-up-world/#3baf31c932a2).  \n\nEase of use is critical to mass customization efforts. Big companies have previously failed to succeed with [mass customisation](https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/11/the-rise-of-online-customization/) because of complex and costly operations.  With digital manufacturing tools at an affordable price, things a changing but it is still essential that the user is required an effort as little as possible. \n\n## From a makers perspective\n<img src=\"../img/details/personal1.jpg\" />\nIn relation to personalised design, makers is far ahead of enterprise and consumer in terms of variation and projects. Many makers make stuff they could buy as mass produced cheaper, just to give it a personal touch. Sometimes they find the product lacking, needs to [tweak](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Kits/HardwareHacking/ForBeginners.html) it a little bit, and thereby [improves](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-12/dc-12-presentations/Fullam/dc-12-fullam.pdf) it, to fulfil their specific needs.\n\n## From a consumer perspective\nCustomisation, designing, tweaking etc. is already very familiar terms for most makers – a part of the movements DNA – but this is still to be fully adapted by the everyday consumer. When it does, it will blur out the lines between consumer and maker. This could be accelerated by technologies like 3D-scanners in everyday devices we surround our self with like smart phones.\nAt present, most makers tend to be male, but this could change when consumers start to co-create their every day-gods. Because of different shopping behaviours of men and women, customisation seems more appealing to women. “Women tend to be more invested in the shopping experience, while men just want to buy a specific item and get out.” [techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/11/the-rise-of-online-customization/)\n\n## From an enterprise perspective\nWe already see a lot of small start-ups but also major brands branding them by mass customisation. The majority of established brands is doing it as a part of a campaign but smaller companies build their business on this approach of personal design. This can lead to higher prices a customers are willing to pay more but more important it also leads to more loyal to company, better products, knowing their customers’ [needs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erik-eliason/mass-customization_b_1313875.html). \nNevertheless, by time this also requires companies to develop and adapt their business model. This is becoming a sales parameter that, so far, only few in each business area is taking advantage of and uses as a sales parameter. When customers get used to having several options in design or do it them self, this will be expected in many industries. The distribution of digital tools for manufacturing along with this trend evolving, the global supply is changing.

      "Name": "Distributed manufacturing",
      "Description": "# Distributed manufacturing \r\nDistributed manufacturing refers to a decentralized production by either enterprises or makers and consumers. This is normally associated with digital manufacturing tools, like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC routers among others, capable of making tangible objects from digital files. Manufacturing with these machines can be organized in a network e.g. a platform like 3D-hubs17, enabling customers to find a local manufacturing service. Consumers can fabricate in their own home, components designed by themselves or found online, or order it in the nearby fabrication service18 (could soon be at the supermarket19). \r\n\r\nUntil now, machines for digital manufacturing have required several steps in the process from finished 3D model to start manufacturing like file converting, error fixing, slicing and other depending on the system, which is all a part of the file preparation. With the Windows 3D Builder App, the 3D printer is connected straight to the computer and is used completely like a normal inkjet printer with no further actions (as you would properly already expect it to do some day). \r\n\r\n## Designed and produced locally \r\nFor some time, the future look out for distributed manufacturing and its effects have been the called the biggest thread to the shipping industry20 21. Since then the hype about e.g. 3D printing have been replaced with a more relaxed view, as Sebastiaan Scholte, CEO Jan De Rijk, says; “maybe (it will) revolutionize traditional manufacturing, but going to enhance traditional manufacturing.” 22 \r\n\r\n## Manufacturing moves closer to the house – but not inside yet \r\nIn the next few years, new technologies for desktop manufacturing will be available with a wider range of materials and more durability than today. Materials for widely used technologies is developing all the time. Regarding 3D print, part quality and properties will still be far from traditional manufacturing e.g. injection moulding, so it will still mainly be for gadgets, toys, small repairs. For the makers the new affordable technologies like DLP and SLS, will have a larger impact and give maker developers opportunities with even more design freedom and higher detail and tolerances. When these machines fully reaches the market, it could catalyse the “every day consumers” interest in 3D print or just the ability to print out a tangible piece at home.  \r\n\r\nIn the nearby future, many print services like Shapeways and iMaterialise will emerge, and they will be more widespread and local. Many smaller print services already exist and are now teaming up with the package delivery services like UPS.23 \r\n\r\nThe distributed manufacturing is , made possible by continuing price reduction24 and at the same time advancing machine capabilities, is also beneficial for developing countries, where residents in rural areas is a long way from advances technology, medical help and sometimes reliable power25. Several organisations26 is facilitating and creating awareness in these areas on life changing tools like prosthetics made with a FDM printer. The same places \r\n\r\nalso benefits from manufacturing of simple replacement parts, where they would normally have to travel the whole day to a bigger city for more expensive parts.27 28 \r\n\r\n## 3.3.3. Consumers will have it their  way \r\nNew materials for printers are surfacing at an even higher pace than the printers are, constantly giving the users new designs and techniques to explore all the time. The urge for products specially designed by one self or available in limited editions etc., is a general trend in the society. (mass customisation)29 30 Erik Eliason express: “Consumers expect it their way.” And Every Customer is Their Own Market”.31 Digital tools for fabrication makes this much easier to achieve, with consumers being able to manufacture by them self or nearby. \r\n\r\nPartly due to quality of the consumer-affordable machines output and especially due to their non-existing ability to print in several materials, it will take a long time before consumers just print their new coffee machine, shaver or smartphone. That being said, an enormous amount of technologies is under development right now, and by time they will merge (PCB and electronics printing)32 and compile all the unique features each technology have today and thereby one day satisfy the everyday consumers expectations and needs at an affordable prize. The idea of printing \r\n\r\nthe finished product with its electronics might not be too far out the future. A few companies is already selling printers and desktop printers with ability to print in multi-material able to print a PCB circuit. \r\n\r\nPrint services will still emerge  in the next five and amazons trucks is going to print on its way to the customer33. Later these will likely close, when consumers get their own multi-material printer, serving their entire needs. Analytics estimate that this market will grove slow in the early years but accelerate after 2020 into a 65 billion euro industry.34 \r\n\r\n## Materials and quality is slowing the movement down \r\nAs the digital tools nearby product developers, designers and end user customers enables possibilities that will change the global supply chain, it is still a technology developing each day. Elements that slows things down is e.g. the range of materials and surface quality. Especially the surface finish of 3D printed parts is - without post processing – still far from conventional manufactured parts. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that could slow things down is the resistance from established companies with violated intellectual properties on designs being shared on file repositories.35 36 \r\n\r\n## From a makers perspective \r\nWhen using conventional manufacturing methods you have to know a great deal about each technique to make sure your design compile with that. When using 3D-printing you can get started with no knowledge at all. This is putting the manufacturing back in the hands of everyday users. \r\n\r\n## From a consumers perspective \r\nMaybe not in 2 years but later on, every consumer would probably find it normal to order ones gadget and pick it up a few hours later in the local shop or print it out them self. The end user could either manufacture it at home, order it at the nearby print service or have it delivered with a truck producing the part on its way. \r\n\r\n## From an enterprise perspective \r\nHaving a tool for digital manufacturing nearby results in faster and cheaper product development, reducing the cost of entry into markets, makes it a lot easier to start new business and for businesses to try out new designs with little risk related to investments in manufacturing tools. 37  \r\n\r\nDecentralised manufacturing may change the balance in global economy. “Part of the global production may shift back to wealthy countries, leading to decreased shipping volumes of goods between Asia and other continents, at the same time increasing the shipping volumes of raw materials between continents.”38 This is of cause a threat to shipping industries but it also creates opportunities. \r\n\r\nIn some industries, minimising waiting time for replacements parts, causing expensive downtime, is crucial. The potential for decentralised manufacturing is enormous. Industries like marine and aerospace see very interesting possibilities in printing parts locally around the world very fast and not having huge expenses on inventories; if a carrier can have a spare part made in every larger airport, harbour or even on the ship, they can reduce “downtime” and save millions. To achieve this kind of setup, it takes years and a lot of money invested in process control, classification, verification and part quality control/assessment. With this in place, it will immediately effect the whole manufacturing industry. \r\n\r\nThese possibilities is also appealing to hospitals where waiting time can cause more severe damage than money loss.39 \r\n\r\nThe final example is probably not for everyone, but instead of bringing all construction materials to the moon when you want to build a space station there, bring a 3D printer and use the lunar sand as material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "Description": "# Open source hardware and open design \r\nOpensource.com, the online community to learn more about how the open source way is improving technologies, education, business, government, etc, states that: \"Open hardware,\" or \"open source hardware,\" refers to the design specifications of a physical object which are licensed in such a way that said object can be studied, modified, created, and distributed by anyone. So \"Open hardware\" is a set of design principles and legal practices, not a specific type of object. The term can therefore refer to any number of objects—like automobiles, chairs, computers, robots, or even houses.\"   \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's also the open source softwatare or code. It works under the same pinciples of the open hardware but aplied to code like: chematics, blueprints, logic designs, Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings or files, etc. So users can access the technology and modify it, fix it, improve it and share it again with the community. \r\n\r\nSo, as stated in Opensource.com: \"Essentially, open hardware eliminates common roadblocks to the design and manufacture of physical goods; it provides as many people as possible the ability to construct, remix, and share their knowledge of hardware design and function.\" As open source design does the same with code. \r\n\r\n## New licenses and Business models \r\nOpen hardware gives a new way to see licenses and business models for companies. Not all the companies that work with open source hardware and design work under the same agreements or licence condition. Some examples, like Arduino (case study of this project) has registered its name as a trademark so others can use their designs, but can't use the Arduino name on them. But RepRap, the 3D printer company, releases all its designs under a free software license: the GNU General Public License. Others like littleBits implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module, in accordance with the CERN Open Hardware License Version 1.2.88 \r\n\r\nOpensource.com clarifies that: \"All open hardware must be accompanied by documentation, including design files and source code. In addition, the license governing the reproduction of open hardware must allow modification and distribution of those design files in a way that allows others to easily obtain them. This makes possible — and even encourages — studying, troubleshooting, modifying, and improving open hardware. If a piece of open hardware incorporates software of any kind, then that software should generally be released under an approved open source license. Alternatively, the open hardware's interfaces should be documented in a way that makes writing open source software for the hardware as easy as possible.Essentially, open hardware is all about making the object as easy to remix and reproduce as possible. Closed hardware uses obfuscation and patent law to make the recreation of the objects as difficult as possible, usually to ensure vendor lock-in in a supply line that doesn't involve hobbyists and makers or other competitors.\" \r\n\r\nMost of these projects are founded with crowfunding campaings on Kickstarter, Indiegogo or Crowdsupply, the specialized website for crowdfunding open hardware projects. \r\n\r\n## Working Groups\r\nThe Open Design + Hardware (OD+H) Working Group is a global network of makers, academics, designers and openness advocates who are working to build a community of practice around open design and hardware across paradigms, from product design to architecture to digital design and physical art. \r\n\r\nOD+H Members aim to provide a central point of reference for the development of OD+H in both theory and in practice. They run workshops, deliver lectures, engage in hands-on collaborative projects and training initiatives, develop domain-specific guides, curate open collections and host events around the world. We also provide a place for discussion amongst practitioners interested in finding new solutions for a wide range of related issues including intellectual property, law, society, free culture and the commons. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe OD+H Working Group was founded in 2012 with the help of the Open Knowledge Foundation (UK) and Aalto University Media Factory (Finland). Notable collaborations in the group’s first year have included hosting an Open Design, Hardware and Fabrication track at the Open Knowledge Festival 2012 in Helsinki, releasing v0.1 of the new Open Design Definition through Github and a series of interactive workshops across Europe, helping support the launch of the first-ever Public Domain Remix competition in France and delivering keynotes about the correlations between design, openness and hardware at LibreGraphics Meeting 2013 in Madrid and at FREE CITY 2012 in Tallinn. \r\n\r\nThe first project they introduced as a group was the Open Design Definition v0.1 on Github in 2012, the first draft of a community-driven thought project to explore a crucial and missing step towards developing our thoughts about the field. They started by integrating the work of several existing definitions for inspiration in this process, including the first Open Design definition drafted in 2000, the Open Design Manifesto, the Open Design page on Wikipedia and the Open Hardware definition. In its current state, they realised, the linguistics of the word “design” include many potential meanings and applications. To quote a much-used phrase, to “design is to design a design to produce a design”. As a group, they aimed to develop this missing definition through inclusive and collaborative methods rooted in public discussion, workshopping and sharing different understandings of the field to ensure such a definition would adequately cover all the potential meanings and applications of design. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, we wanted the product of this collaboration to be developed and “owned” by a wide community of people interested in open design. The result was the first release of The Open Design Definition in early 2013 on Github, and this definition is still evolving through further discussion. Below is a comic outlining the initial steps of this process. \r\n\r\nDesigner revisions on the Github repo continue today, and we periodically organise “Github for Designers” tutorials around the world to help continue this work abroad. Interested in being a part of this project? Please email us to get started. \r\n\r\n## Open source hardware and design for makers\r\nOpen hardware is facilitating STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in primary and secondary schools, universities and post-graduate schools, making it much easier to find a project to contribute to or as instructions to start a building a copy in the school. This is also the case for individual citizens, but for some time it must be considered for the innovators / early adaptors as this requires a lot of tinkering and technical insight. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "Description": "# Immersive Interaction\n\n## Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality\nIn recent years, we have seen the adoption of mobile computing with mobile phones and tablets to a degree where it overtook the use of the traditional laptop/PC at an unexpected pace. Early 2017 Android overtook Windows as the most used Operating System to browse the Web . a sign that consumers have definitely changed the way how we connect online. The mobility aspect has introduced all kinds of new services (e.g. location based services) and has changed how, when and where we communicate and consume.\n<img src=\"../img/details/sensorama.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin:10px;width:250px\" />\n\nOne thing that has remained the same mostly of the years that we still mostly interact with screens. Once we interact with a screen we are slightly removed from the actual reality. It has fascinated researchers for many years what would happen if we could interact differently with computers. One of the first pioneers in this field was Morton Heilig. In 1962 he build the Sensorama (Figure 15), an experiment in user interaction that uses not only sight, but also touch, sound, smell and air.\n\nIn the following years most innovations didn’t leave the laboratory. The name Virtual Reality was introduced in 1987, followed by Augmented Reality in 1990. Virtually Reality is a technology that uses headset to project an immersive 3D environment for the user. In order to do so, the headset needs to track the position and orientation of the person and most often needs a powerful computer to generate the images. For the user it feels like he or she is in a completely different environment.\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/minecraft.jpg\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;width:250px\" /> Augmented Reality on the other hand, uses an overlay to project graphics over the actual environment. This requires less graphical resources, but most often needs a more advanced mapping system to localize the position of the use in relation to his or her surroundings. Compared to Virtual Reality, the adoption and technical readiness level of Augmented Reality is still behind, but compared to the mouse that was invented in the same time period Virtual- and Augmented reality both had a rough and slow start.\n\nSo will that change now with the recent introduction of commercial products like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and the Microsoft HoloLens? Or even more important why would we want use these devices at all?\n\n## Military and Industry take the lead\n\nIn general you could say that Virtual Reality with its ability to generate complete new environment is especially useful for gaming and training settings. For years the army is using games like Virtual Battlespace92 to train its soldiers to collaborate, the next step is a realistic VR environment 93 with full battle simulations.\n\nThe industry is currently discovering the use of Virtual Reality for training situations as well. A complete job floor could be generated within a VR experience for training an operator how to do his or her job. Some of the VR headsets like the HTC Vive are accompanied by wireless controllers to track all hand movements to really operate machines or logistic tasks. Although the headsets have really improved over these last years, people can still experience motion sickness when using VR. This VR motion sickness94 could be a barrier for the effectiveness of longer training sessions\n\nBecause Augmented Reality really relies on the environment of the user, the typical use cases of AR can be expected on the actual job floor itself. An operator could get work instructions for repairing or assembling tasks, he or she could be presented with information and visualisation overlays that would not have been available or using remote support an expert could give instructions while ‘virtually’ looking over his shoulder. Many of these applications are currently being piloted by companies like Volkswagen, Siemens and Boeing and if found useful could be expected to be used on a broader scale in the coming years.\n\n## Augmented Reality for makers\n\nOne of the reasons that AR headsets have not been so widely used within the maker scene is probably the price tag of the headsets. The most popular AR headset at this moment, the Microsoft HoloLens, has a price tag of $3.000. Another issue with current generation is that the window of overlay is often too small. This limited field-of view is in stark contrast with the VR experience. But already companies have announced cheaper headsets with a larger field-of-view, so we can expect prices to lower, making AR also affordable for consumers. and its limited\n\nHow would makers use VR and AR? Education, training and collaboration are probably among the first domains to be explored. There are already 3D\n\ndesign tools in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. With a couple of simple hand gestures you can build your 3D models with the HoloLens in an app called HoloStudio95.\n\nAn education use case could be the following: makers could be assisted with their tools and activities while having someone else ‘virtually sitting’ next to them giving suggestions or instructions. That someone else could be a friend or expert that is actually somewhere else or it could be a virtual assistant with the knowledge of the tools and specific thing you want to make. This could work for assembling a 3D printer, soldering sensors on an Arduino microcontroller or even building with Lego.",

      "Description": "# Data analytics\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/analytics1.png\" style=\"width:300px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>With the gaining popularity of IoT and wireless sensor networks that will be monitoring our health, cities, industries and houses a lot more sensor data is expected to be gathered over the next decennia. But the goal of using the Internet of Things most often is not to gather data, but to make better decisions. Better said: to assist people in making better decisions. Gartner's analytics maturity model  identified four different types of analytics: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive. Descriptive and diagnostic analytics help to understand what is happening and why this is happening. Predictive and prescriptive analytics are used to see what is going to happen and how to influence are needed to predict what is going to happen or how too make it happen. In working with IoT and 'big data' most initiatives still would be happy to fully utilize the first two types of analytics. The technical challenges in data collection and storage are sometimes already overwhelming.\n\n## Data handling for IoT\n Already many different ‘big data’ solutions are surfacing to collect, store and analyze this data. Cloud computing companies are offering a wide range of solutions for connecting devices, collecting data, storage, analyzing and visualization of data. \n \nAt the same time many companies share and collaborate on open source software to handle this IoT data. The Apache Software Foundation  for example supports many open source initiatives like Apache Hadoop , a framework for storing big data, Apache Spark , a framework to facilitate large-scale data processing, and Apache Zeppelin  a tool for interactive analytics.\n\nIt is good to note that gathering data is almost never the real goal in working with IoT. The data is in the end needed to make decisions. Decisions made by humans or decisions made in an automated control loop. Traditionally businesses would rely on spreadsheets, database queries, custom digital dashboard and Business Intelligence tools like Tableau and Qlik. But most of these applications are not ready for the potential scale of the amount of data they need to handle in large scale IoT setups. \n\nOne approach to handle this problem is to use computing clusters with scalable databases and analytics platforms, like Hadoop and Spark. These platforms are able to distribute storage and calculations over  multiple machines (thousands, if needed). This requires a different way of programming, but already many programming languages and  Business Intelligence tools are able to connect to these computing clusters.\nGPU-accelerated computing is another way to accelerate applications that need to handle large calculations. A GPU (graphics processing unit) is a processor that is very good in handling multiple tasks at the same time, with relative low energy consumption. Companies like MapD   are introducing new databases and analytics platforms that leverage GPU-accelerated computing and at the same promising a scalable architecture. This combination has the potential to really unlock the promise of IoT data analytics.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence\n\nFor really learn from the acquired data (starting with diagnostic analytics) typically people turn to Artificial intelligence (AI), a subfield of computer science that studies intelligence exhibited by machines. The field has developed in close relationship with research on neuronetworks, mathematics, linguistics, sociology and psychology.\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/analytics2.jpg\" style=\"width:250px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>Artificial intelligence is often implemented as a machine or a computer program that is able to recreate intelligent behavior (usually only attributed to human mind) such as accomplishing a complex goal.  The definition of artificial is evolving as it gets more and more capable over time but it usually refers to the ability to mimic human like intelligent behavior such as learning and problem solving.\n\nA weak AI is geared toward a specific task while a strong or full AI would attempt to solve all problems that a human brain can (reason, language, creativity).\nAlthough there is much debate on properly coining the terminology – what is intelligence and how to quantify it, it is currently accepted that all AIs up to date and are weak AIs. And this is mostly likely to be the case in the next 2 years.\nAn AI is a device (agent) that captures information about its environment through various means (physical or virtual sensors) and responds to this information in a perception action cycle. The actions taken by the agent maximize the chances of success towards a specific goal.\nThe last few years have seen a number of weak AIs performing better at specific tasks than humans. A library of weak AIs that outperform humans at various tasks is currently being rapidly developed. Full AI might emerge in a bit longer time frame (2 to 5 years) but it has the potential to outperform humans in all aspects.    \n\n## AI will automate and outperform\nAny job that can be automated will be automated. This is both a threat and an opportunity as it will lead to people working on more creative tasks, therefore to a rise in the maker movement. Automation of task should allow to “free up” time for humans to work on more advances tasks that the AI cannot achieve (mostly creative tasks) yet and raise the value of what is being produced.\n\nOnce Strong AI (or full AI) becomes available it has the potential to outperform humans in all possible aspects. Humanity will not be able to control AIs for their own purpose and the saying “if you cannot beat them, join them” will become more than relevant. Technologies like the neurolink will become key for human to be able to enhance themselves and take full advantage of the power of those AI , by connecting or even merging with them.\n\n## Will humans stay in control?\nAI comes with many very real threats. In the next 2 years, it will primarily threaten jobs. Automation usually affected the most repetitive jobs not requiring high level of education, but with the arrival of machine learning AI, all type of jobs having a repetitive aspect are now threatened. For example a specialist eye doctor can train more than 10 years to be able to recognize specific eye sickness, only one or few doctors will be needed to train an AI to do this task and collecting enough data. Such AI can quickly outperform any human to this specific task. Ethical issues of how undirected intelligence can be harmful as well as lost jobs are the current main concerns.\n\nAI is one of the most controversial fields and has many top researchers worried about a future where a superintelligence becomes more intelligent than any human. Making AI safe and controllable is considered as important as further developing the technology. You could imagine that AI becomes highly regulated to insure that humans stay in control as long as possible. The difficulty usually comes when AI start designing the next generation of AI, as it will reach a moment where this task will become fully automated to a level out of human understanding. Each generation of new AI could come faster than the precedent one and be much more intelligent every time. This exponential growth seems impossible to control for humans. It is usually referred to as the technological singularity.  The threat being that super intelligence could take control of robots and the faith of humanity will then rely on them. They could decide to help humanity, co-exist with it, stay hidden and spy on it, control it, eliminate it, or could be not interested at all in humanity and pursue other goals elsewhere.      \n\n\n\n\n",

      "Name": "Maker Education Programs",
      "Description": "# Maker Education Programs\r\n\r\nMaker Education is a term coined by Dale Dougherty in 2013  that is closely associated with STEM learning, is an approach to problem-based and project-based learning that relies upon hands-on, often collaborative, learning experiences as a method for solving authentic problems.\r\nAs stated before, people who participate in making often call themselves \"makers\"  of the Maker movement and develop their projects in Makerspaces, Fab Labs, or development studios which emphasize prototyping and the repurposing of found objects in service of creating new inventions or innovations. Culturally, this kind of spaces are, both inside and outside of schools, are associated with collaboration and the free flow of ideas.\r\nIn schools, maker education stresses the importance of learner-driven experience, interdisciplinary learning, peer-to-peer teaching, iteration, and the notion of \"failing forward,\" or the idea that mistake-based learning is crucial to the learning process and eventual success of a project.\r\nMaker Education is an offshoot of the Maker Movement, which Time Magazine described as \"\"the umbrella term for independent innovators, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, Make, as well as hands-on Maker Faires that are catnip for DIYers who used to toil in solitude.\"\" Dale Dougherty, founder of the Maker Faire and Make magazine, called in his 2011 TED Talk for making to be embraced in education, as students are the new generation of makers.\r\n\r\n### Maker Education best practice: Fab Academy.\r\nFab Labs are structured in a network and they propose the Fab Academy program as a Maker Educational program. On the other hand, Makerspaces haven't not organized a global Maker Educational program yet. So, as in many other spaces and development studios the Maker educational offer sticks to workshops about \"maker-related\" topics (or just the ones that the community is interested in). This program generates a lot of interchange between students from different fields. This makes that new ideas and solutions emerge from that mix of knowledge, needs and networking. In addition, the hands-on learning makes students very active and involved.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Academy teaches principles and applications of digital fabrication. It was developed to teach hands-on skills in fab labs, which began as an outreach project from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms, and has grown into a global network of more than 500 labs. Fab Academy instruction is based on MIT’s popular rapid-prototyping course How To Make (almost) Anything, both taught by Prof. Neil Gershenfeld.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to Make (Almost) Anything in a distributed education platform all over the world\r\nFab Academy offers a distributed rather than distance educational model: students learn in local workgroups, with peers, mentors, and machines, which are then connected globally by content sharing and video for interactive classes. The individual labs are supported and supervised regionally by supernode sites with more advanced capabilities, expertise, and inventories.\r\nEach lab that participates in the Fab Academy program is part of a global Fab Lab / Fab Academy network. The local branches of the Fab Academy work with other participating Fab Labs and experts from around the world via a distributed educational model where the local fab lab pool the knowledge to provide a unique educational experience.\r\nList of Fab Labs running Fab Academy program: http://fabacademy.org/2017-nodes-supernodes/\r\nFab Academy students view and participate in global lectures broadcast from MIT on Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST. The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. In addition to the lectures, there are two lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.\r\nFab Academy faculty, who are leaders in their respective fields provide global video lectures, supervise academic content, and guide research. Hands-on instruction in the labs is provided by instructors who supervise and evaluate Certificates, develop and disseminate instructional material, and assist with projects.\r\n\r\n### Fab Academy Contents\r\nJust as communications and computation went from analog to digital, resulting in PCs and the Internet, the\r\ndigitization of fabrication is leading to personal fabricators that will allow anyone to make almost anything,\r\nanywhere. The development of digital fabrication is based on creating codes that don’t just describe things, they are\r\nthings, much as proteins are coded in molecular biology. This research roadmap is ultimately aiming at a Star Trekstyle replicator, but prototype versions of these capabilities are already available in field fab labs.\r\nAt the Fab Academy, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their ideas through many hours of\r\nhands-on experience with digital fabrication tools. They learn a variety of code formats and turn them into physical objects. The Fab Academy is a fast paced, hands-on learning experience where students plan and execute a new project each week. Each individual documents their progress for each project, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments. Students at the Fab Academy learn:\r\n\r\n* How to use a Fab Lab’s digital fabrication tools for rapid prototyping:\r\n    * Epilog Mini Lasercutter\r\n    * Roland MDX-20 Milling Machine\r\n    * 3D printer\r\n    * Roland CAMM-1 Servo GX-24 Desktop Vinyl Cutter\r\n    * ShopBot CNC Router\r\n* Electronics design and production by producing circuit boards using a variety of sensors and output devices.\r\n* How to program AVR microcontrollers on the boards they have produced.\r\n* Molding and casting\r\n* 3D scanning and printing\r\n\r\nThe diploma combines 19 certificates provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. The certificates are:\r\n* Digital fabrication principles and practices – 1 week \r\n* Computer-aided design, manufacturing, and modeling – 1 week \r\n* Computer-controlled cutting – 1 week \r\n* Electronics design and production – 2 weeks \r\n* Computer-controlled machining – 1 week \r\n* Embedded programming – 1 week \r\n* 3D molding and casting – 1 week \r\n* 3D scanning and printing – 1 week \r\n* Sensors, actuators, and displays – 2 weeks \r\n* Interface and application programming – 1 week \r\n* Embedded networking and communications – 1 week \r\n* Machine design – 2 weeks \r\n* Digital fabrication applications and implications – 1 week \r\n* Invention, intellectual property, and business models – 1 week \r\n* Digital fabrication project development – 2 weeks \r\n\r\n### Is Maker Education, not making\r\nThough Maker Education has been embraced by thousands of schools, there has also emerged criticism of the movement.\r\nThe Critical Theory of Maker Education asserts that Maker Education curriculum and pedagogy necessarily aligns itself with the greater educational imperative (as described in the Critical Pedagogy Primer) that \"\"questions of democracy and justice cannot be separated from the most fundamental features of teaching and learning\"\" (Kincheloe, Joe L. (2008). Critical Pedagogy. Peter Lang Primer. p. 5. ISBN 978-0-8204-7262-1.). Foundational Critical Theorists like Paulo Freire in his seminal work, Pedagogy of the Oppressed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed), stressed the need for a new relationship between teacher, student, and school, that would cultivate in students radical liberation from the political injustices that oppress them. Maker Education is another avenue by which radical liberation is possible.\r\nIn his article “A more lovingly made world,”(Wark, McKenzie (2013). \"\"A more lovingly made world\"\". Cultural Studies Review. 19: 296–304) McKenzie Wark of The New School (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School) writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don’t actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn’t teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though Chris Anderson and Mark Hatch evoke Marx in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer.\r\nAlessandro Carelli, Massimo Bianchini, and Venanzio Arquilla of the Politecnico di Milano argue that Maker Culture presents a \"\"maker contradiction\"\" in which DIY producers in the \"\"so-called Third Industrial Revolution\"\" become post-production consumers, further reinforcing hierarchies of social, political, and economic power (Carelli, Alessandro; Massimo Bianchini, and Venanzio Arquilla (2014). \"\"The 'Makers contradiction.' The shift from a counterculture-driven DIY production to a new form of DIY consumption\"\". 5th STS Italia Conference A Matter of Design: Making Society through Science and Technology).\r\nAmong other critics, Evgeny Morozov, a Belarusian writer and researcher, focuses on the impact, both social and political, of technology. In his article published in The New Yorker, entitled, “Making It: Pick up a spot welder and join the revolution”,[11: \"\"Making It\"\". The New Yorker. Retrieved 2016-12-12.] Morozov criticizes Chris Anderson for “confusing the history of the Web with the history of capitalism and ends by speculating about the future of the maker movement, which, on closer examination, is actually speculation on the future of capitalism.” He also criticizes companies and organizations that were once committed to open source software for becoming acquired by for-profit companies and embroiled in copyright and trademark lawsuits. Morozov also criticizes the maker movement’s major contributors financial relationship with DARPA, which made a $10 million grant to support maker education for high school students, and $3.5 million to TechShop to establish new makerspaces.\r\n\r\nWhile Morozov is one of the more vocal critics of Maker Education, he is not the only one. Debbie Chachra, associate professor at Olin College of Engineering, in her article in January 23, 2015 issue of The Atlantic, entitled, “Why I Am Not a Maker”,[12: Chachra, Debbie. \"\"Why I Am Not a Maker\"\". The Atlantic. Retrieved 2016-12-12.] centers her criticism on “the social history of who makes things -- and who doesn’t.” Chachra describes the history of the “makers” of products as men, rather than those who cared for “hearth and home”, that is, historically, women. She calls for recognition of “the work of the educators, those that analyze and characterize and critique, everyone who fixes things, all the other people who do valuable work with and for others - above all, the caregivers - whose work isn’t about something you can put in a box and sell.”\r\nFinally, Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of Northwestern University, and Meg Escude of Exploratorium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratorium), offer an in-depth look at the ways in which Maker Education reinforces educational inequality. They begin by offering Haitian writer, Edwidge Danticat’s commentary on making: “If you can’t afford clothes, but you can make them--make them. You have to work with what you have, especially if you don’t ‘have a lot of money. You use creativity, and you use imagination.” Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude make the case that true making is often born from difficult environmental circumstances, and that what local communities once did as part of their daily lives (offering an exchange of skills and knowledge, for example, to help others in need in the community) is now being offered to low-income neighborhoods as an intervention program, promising greater educational equality. They argue that the “American Maker” highlighted by Dale Dougherty in his 2011 Ted Talk, is symptomatic of the problems associated with American exceptionalism, in that it is “grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices.” Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for “equity-oriented design” of maker experiences which include, “critical analyses or educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making.”\r\n\r\n### Maker education is for the general public\r\nMaker education is facilitating and supporting STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in primary and secondary schools, universities and post-graduate schools. In some areas where STEM is not an integrated part of the schools educational program, fab labs, maker spaces and maker education programs, might be the only way into the world of making for the student. This is also the case for individual citizens, but for some time it must be considered for the innovators / early adaptors.\r\n\r\nDpite these Makeder educational prgrams don't have a closed curriculum, they normally are the door to the \"making\" world for makers. Normally they start their journey with one of thesse programs that gives them the tools to keep researching and making until they realise their projects. So, we could say that Maker educational progarams are useful for makers, if they are specific on a topic for example, but normally they are more focused on kids or students that could become makers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "Description": "# Internet of Things Infrastructure & Security\n\n## Smart, intelligent and connected\nThe world is buzzing around the Internet of Things. Everything is becoming smart, intelligent and connected from cups  that make sure you hydrate intelligently, pets , diapers  and even complete smart cities .  With the rise of popularity of microcontrollers like the Arduino, the Maker Movement seems to become an infinite source of creativity. While not all new connected devices will turn out to be useful or relevant in the long term, this IoT trend has started and is already impacting the way we interact with our houses with products like the Amazon Echo  and smart lightbulbs or how we play sports and exercise with one of many of the  fitness trackers.\n\nAlso the industry is embracing this trend with applications across the domain of energy to fully optimize the use of your energy grid, health to monitor our wellness, automotive to enable safe self-driving cars and off course smart manufacturing to optimize production. Cities are looking into IoT to optimize transportation, waste management, safety, etc. Juniper  predicts that the number of connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices, sensors and actuators will reach over 46 billion in 2021. \n\n## Connectivity for IoT\nAlthough more factors drive the Internet of Things, like the advancements in microcontrollers and artificial intelligence, wireless connectivity is one of the enablers of the Internet of Thigs. Wireless protocols range from short range like Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave and WiFi to long range technologies like satellite communication and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN). Short range wireless are often used in home automation or for personal devices. \nLong range wireless technologies like (LPWAN) have existed for quite a while, but only these last year are being discovered by makers with the popularity of  of LoRa  and SigFox . LPWAN has a limited bandwidth and the devices are only allowed to send a limited number of message each day, but they are very power efficient and can sometimes run for a couple of years on batteries. These features make them ideal for sensor networks, for example to measure air quality or track bicycles.  \n\nLoRa, a LPWAN example,  is interesting because it uses an unlicensed radio spectrum, it allows makers to create their own IoT infrastructure with just a Raspberry Pi  without  the need of a paid subscription from a mobile operator. Initiatives like The Things Network  plan to build a global network infrastructure by providing cheap gateways, open-source firmware and encourage and facilitate their community in building applications with tutorials, YouTube videos and code on GitHub.  \n\nThis trend has not been overlooked by the telecom industry, several mobile operators are readying their own LoRa network or focussing on NarrowBand  IoT  (NB-IoT) a licenced alternative that for some mobile operators requires just a software update for their existing infrastructure. On the long term 5G, the next standard for mobile wireless communication, also specifically provides solutions for IoT communication. \n\n## Will it be safe?\nAs we are entering the era of Internet of Things, we get surrounded by devices that have access to home or company networks. With several recent incidents, like the attack on internet infrastructure company Dyn , it is clear that these devices can pose a threat not only to the integrity of these networks15 but also to critical internet infrastructures. Not many consumers are aware of these vulnerabilities as they buy their new television, smart light bulb, door lock or fitness bracelet. With many different network and communication protocols, suppliers and products are all competing in the same market. At the same time security has been not been highest priority. With possible severe consequences, experts      urge all stakeholders (manufactures, legislators and users) to come up with regulations and enhance the cybersecurity awareness.      ",

      "Description": "# Smart Citizen Sensor Networks\n\nA Smart Citizen Sensor Network is an environmental sensing network most often operating in the public domain. This means that the sensors and their data are connected to each other and they come from citizen sources. Nowadays, citizens use sensing technologies daily, like GPS, videos, etc. combined with the web 2.0 technologies, like social network platforms, P2P computing, etc., so they can participate actively in the network as sensors of the issue they need to gather information and improve. \n\n<img src=\"../img/details/smartcitizen1.jpg\" style=\"width:250px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>\n<img src=\"../img/details/smartcitizen2.jpg\" style=\"width:250px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>\n\nAs René Post, from Waag Society says about it on the Making Sense project website (http://making-sense.eu/covey-design-smart-citizens-sensor-networks/), \"in order to build successful sensor-networks around a certain environmental issue, we need to combine the elements of (1) concern, awareness, and (2) frustration due to lack of data to start the project. But, in order to keep citizens involved, it might be a good idea to present people not just with numbers, but (3) compile these numbers into actionable information.\"\nThe main purpose of these networks is to generate participatory processes of people in the cities. These participatory processes normally tackle an environmental issue that citizens want to improve connecting data, people and knowledge.\n\n## Creating a Smart Citizen Network with Smart Citizens Kit and Making Sense project\nSmart Citizen is a platform to generate participatory processes of people in the cities. Connecting data, people and knowledge, the objective of the platform is to serve as a node for building productive and open indicators, and distributed tools, and thereafter the collective construction of the city for its own inhabitants.\n\nThe Smart Citizen project is based on geolocation, the Internet and free hardware and software for data collection and sharing. It connects people with their environment and their city to create more effective and optimized relationships between resources, technology, communities, services and events in the urban environment.\nThe Smart Citizen platform is a full set of of tools waiting from you to start using them: register to the platform, check the API, download the Android app, get a Kit or contribute to the open-source project.\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/smartcitizen3.png\" style=\"width:250px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>\n<img src=\"../img/details/smartcitizen4.jpg\" style=\"width:250px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>\n\nThe Smart Citizen Kit is a piece of hardware comprised of a sensor and a data-processing board, a battery and an enclousure. The first board carries sensors that measure air composition (CO and NO2), temperature, humidity, light intensity and sound levels. Once it’s set up, the device will stream data measured by the sensors over Wi-Fi using the FCC-certified, wireless module on the data-processing board. The device’s low power consumption allows for placing it on balconies and windowsills. Power to the device can be provided by a solar panel and/or battery. The Kit is not another black box, it is compatible with Arduino and all the design files are open-source (schematics and firmware). For more detailed hardware specifications visit https://docs.smartcitizen.me/#/start/hardware\nThe project is born within Fab Lab Barcelona at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, both focused centers on the impact of new technologies at different scales of human habitat, from the bits to geography. It also got founded thanks to lovely bakers on Kickstarter (2013) and Goteo (2012).\nMaking Sense is a European funded project that will run for two years between 2015 and 2017. The aim is to explore how open source software, open source hardware, digital maker practices and open design can be effectively used by local communities to fabricate their own sensing tools, make sense of their environments and address pressing environmental problems in air, water, soil and sound pollution.\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/smartcitizen5.png\" />\n \nThe project will tackle that issues using three strategies. First of all, using open source technologies that gather environmental data with communities across Europe, they will be co-creating sensors & devices that use the Smart Citizen platform to capture environmental data.\nThey will also enable and design platforms for collective sensemaking: testing tools and methodologies for making sense of data in pilots in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Prishtina, and raising awareness of social and environmental issues.\n\nThe project will also take action by moving on a trajectory from awareness to positive change: with the pilot learnings they will develop the Making Sense toolkit – a manual to organise citizen sensing campaigns for positive social change. And a Minimum Viable Open Manifesto to provide other projects and their communities with our own insights to better devise citizen engagement strategies and sustainable action plans. The process is currently open and ongoing and it accepts all contributions from all possible sources to keep on amassing new lessons.\n\nThese are some lessons on the participatory and community building side of Making Sense, mainly harvested and developed from the activities and debates that took place in the past year: A MINIMUM VIABLE OPEN MANIFESTO\n[Part 1](http://making-sense.eu/towards-minimum-viable-open-manifesto-1)\n[Part 2](http://making-sense.eu/towards-minimum-viable-open-manifesto-2)\n[Part 3](http://making-sense.eu/towards-minimum-viable-open-manifesto-3)\n\n",

      "Name": "Biofabrication & Smart materials",
      "Description": "# Biofabrication and smart materials\n\nMaterials are developing even faster than the machines for digital manufacturing. Material science is not a new trend, but in the near past, a lot of new material have reached the market for small 3D printers. This progress is presumed to be led by the wide distribution of small and affordable printers in every school and lab around the world. This is only expecting to grow faster. Here is a good overview of the normal materials for [FDM printing](https://all3dp.com/best-3d-printer-filament-types-pla-abs-pet-exotic-wood-metal/). Biofabriaction is one of the innovations in new 3D printing techniques and materials that could potentially have a big impact on the medical world. In labs around the world researchers are also working it. \n\n## Biofabrication \nBiofabrication is the automatic combination and assembly of cells, biochemical or other scaffolding structures to produce tissues (in 2D) or organs (in 3D). This field is the natural evolution of tissue engineering research with cells and stem cells, which is now going toward 3 dimensions and full automation of the process. This field is very active in term of research and the first clinical implementation for bladder fabrication is already available. The time horizon for many more application is 2-10 years. \n\n## Lifetime extension and quality enhancement\nBiofabrication brings the opportunity to create customized human spare parts, answering a huge need for organ transplant as well as making the medication need after transplant irrelevant as the organs are made fully biocompatible using the patient own cells. Anyone in the general public, who need an organ spare part, will likely be able to \"order it\" and have it produced from a \"Bioprinter\". \n In short the opportunity is lifetime extension and life quality enhancement. It also brings the possibility to “upgrade” itself with better body parts. Biofabrication evolution is likely to meet with biomechatronic science and create a new field of cybernetic organism (cyborg) and biological- computer interfaces such as Neuralink .\n \nWhen engineering humans, ethical question come into consideration, as soon as the possibility for body enhancement will be available to many, there will certainly be regulation by countries that will define what can be done or not.  Also the very regulated processes in the field of medicine will certainly create quite some delay between the technology ready for use and the wide adoption of the technology to the masses.\nExisting biotechnology companies might find a lot of inspiration by this trend and by using their existing experience will be able to innovate in the field. New biotech companies will have the opportunities to innovate in the field with minimum investment needed. It is also a field that will most likely not be affected by any sort of financial crisis, with a very strong value proposition. \n\nThe equipment needed to start biofabrication is becoming cheap and accessible to all. Makers are already practicing what is called Biohacking (biofabrication by makers), by doing so biohackers might be the one to create the first biotechnologies company on the market with concrete application of biofabrication. \n\n## 4D printing and smart materials\n<img src=\"../img/details/bio1.jpg\" style=\"width:250px;float:right;margin:10px\"/>Another concept that is related to smart materials trend is 4D printing: 3D printed structures that can change to a “pre-programmed” shape by some kind of external change in the environment. This is possible with “smart materials”. These materials can be effected by either current, temperature, water or other chemical impact. The term also refers to self-assembly of several parts into one part printed in multi-material impacted by e.g. a shake to transform it-self into a new shape. So either the material or each part of the assembly can be “programmed” to act (bend, change size etc.) in a certain way, transforming into a new geometry.\n\n4D printing is a relative new concept, and have so far found very few actual applications. The potential is unpredictable, and MIT have a self-Assembly Lab dedicated to this with Skylar Tibbits talking about a self-assembly world.\n \n<img src=\"../img/details/bio2.png\" style=\"width:250px;float:left;margin:10px\"/>For instance, an idea is that valves in flow systems can close and open at specific temperatures and underground pipes can repair them self by expanding and closing holes, cracks etc. when exposed to water or the whole system of pipes can adapt to an increased demand. \n\nAnother creative thought is that buildings in the future with smart materials will change shape or function by water and heat to in order to increase comfort inside.  \nMaterials for a regular FDM printer could soon be ￼available to makers and other tinkerers.  \n￼It's hard to tell what real applications there will be for 4D printing but the researchers in Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science , Australia, is currently working on a hand for robotic  prosthetics. The hand is made with 3d printed smart materials that will respond to impulses from the brain via an interfaces on the users muscles. \n",

      "Description": "# Virtual Currencies & Blockchain\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/vc1.jpg\" style=\"float:right;width:200px;margin:10px\"/>A virtual currency is digital money that is not issued by a bank or a public authority, but which is accepted as mean of electronic payment. Historically virtual currencies were issued and used within the limit of a specific virtual community but the success of cryptocurrencies like bitcoins (seen as a safe asset) made such currencies real alternative to classical currencies. Cryptocurrencies are powered by the blockchain technology which makes them reliable and trustworthy. The virtual currency trend is now quickly growing (thanks to the blockchain technology powering it) into more than just a currency but into a trust platform for exchanging value where the virtual currency comes fully embedded within the platform ( like Ether for Ethereum ). The time horizon is soon (0-2 years) for early adopters but will certainly hit mainstream later (2-5 years).    \n\n## A complete change in trade\n<img src=\"../img/details/vc2.jpg\" style=\"float:right;width:200px;margin:10px\"/>The blockchain will provide a platform for exchange of value and will allow automating most services doing this today.  Bitcoin was running on blockchain technology, but was (simply put) just a database listing who owns what amount of bitcoins. Blockchain technology is now evolving and powering, not only a database (to keep track of ownership of the cryptocurrency), but it can execute programmed instruction in a decentralized way. This makes it a decentralized computer that can be trusted to run specific programs (and you can trust the programs will not be tempered with). This allows creating smart contracts which can replace the need for having traditional contracts, as the contract itself is the execution of this program. The smart contract effects the logic of execution of the contract clauses. This automation, with the help of the internet of things, will bring the “middle man” cost in the service industry to be nearly null. \nThis will enable new business models for application that would have otherwise not been profitable. For example a E-lock connected to the blockchain could allow you to rent your bike. This is a quite disrupting trend as it has the potential to totally revolutionize the world of finance governing at the moment. But it is also a huge opportunity to create more value and change society as we know it.   \n\n## Driven by the financial sector\n<img src=\"../img/details/vc3.jpg\" style=\"float:right;width:200px;margin:10px\"/>The financial sector is aware that such trend could disrupt the established system quite seriously; therefore there is currently important investment into Fintech (Finance technology) to be sure to be part of the disruption. A technology is just a tool and is very dependent on the use made from it, so such investment from the financial sector could be a mean to control and delay adoption. Regulation in the area will also play an important role to adoption.  \n\n## New ecosystem for maker sustainability\nThe potential of blockchain technology and virtual currencies for Makers an opportunity to operate and exchange value within a virtual community. This could be a key element of creating an ecosystem for maker sustainability. An ecosystem that makes it easy for each maker contributing to a certain project (open source or not), not knowing if it will ever commercialise, to get not only the credit for the work but also paid.\nToday reserved to a limited crowd, virtual currencies could become a new money reference and be used by mainstream users (everyone) in the later future. For companies such technology could reduce many cost while bringing trust for value exchange.\n",

      "Name": "Industrial 3D Printing",
      "Description": "# Industrial 3D Printing\nIndustrial 3D printing is associated with additive manufacturing (AM) for “mass” production of parts more than prototypes for fast innovation.  \n\nIn Wohlers Report 2017 the industry growth is documented. Wohlers associates define “industrial systems” as AM systems sold for $5000 or more. In 2015 a negative growth is documented and in 2016 a 4% growth is observed51 This is in strong contrast to the growth within the “desktop 3D printer sales” (systems below $5000) where a growth of 49% was observed in 2016 (75% in 2015 and 87% in 2014). \n\nHowever, large investments are made within industrial 3D Printing. For instance, in 2016, General Electrics invested approximately 1.3 billion dollars in two producers of metal printer. This indicates that a growth in the coming years is very likely. Generally, large industries as aviation, maritime, automotive and aerospace is investing more in the process and focus have been on production reliability, certification of products and quality assurance/control. \n\n## Right now: transformation to production \nThe focus in industrial 3D printing right now is on reproducibility and reliability. Several large projects between the 3D industry and e.g. the aviation industry carried out in recent years, have not been about exploring what is possible with the geometric freedom or to optimize a certain component, but instead to feel safe about the machine producing an exact copy each time - without [defects](http://www.rep-air.eu/). \n\nIn 2015 the percentage of revenue from AM going to final part production increased above 50% - and in 2016 more than 60% of AM revenue was for final part production. This shows that prototyping is not the main application of 3D print anymore. Metal AM is one of the main reasons for this shift in balance – and the development is expected to continue.  \n\nMetal 3D printing can be expensive compared to what is expected from conventional manufacturing. This is partly due to a lot of manual processes before and after the fabrication. In the nearby future large 3D print services will restructure their facilities in order to get more automated processes. A large metal 3D print production facility opened in 2016 in Germany and more in Europe is expected. \n\nMore and more Industrial 3D Printing “factories” are constructed. For instance, Siemens is mass producing gas [turbines](https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/industry-and-automation/additive-manufacturing-3d-spare-parts-gas-turbines.html), Michelin is mass producing tire [moulds](http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/20170112/NEWS/170119986/michelin-3d-printing-jv-to-aid-mold-design) and FIT additive manufacturing group recently opened the FIT factory acting as a AM production sub-supplier56.  \n\nA few metal printers in the 100.000 dollars range currently exists, and rapid developments are made to further decrease the price of both machines and consumables. \n\n## New complications for manufacturing\nWhen 3D printing is disrupting manufacturing industry and is starting to produce actual components (e.g. vital parts for a jet motor for passenger aircrafts) and  the technology completely relies on digital files being converted and transferred from one computer to another through company networks, this opens up to the risk of a digital file being hacked. A hack in the CAD-drawing that changes the finished part with an internal defect. And if this defect is not visible with a simple visual inspection, it can lead to damage over time or when the component is heavily stressed. Researchers did this to show that the new age of manufacturing is vulnerable and the digital infrastructure is critical and [underestimated](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/3d-printing-hack-researchers-crash-drone-with-sabotaged-propeller/). One could argue, that digital manufacturing is not new, with programmed CNC machines, but 3D- printing gives new geometrical opportunities and thereby also vulnerabilities.  \n\nStandardization and certification of 3D printed parts has been a major barrier for a wider use of industrial 3D Printing. However, a number of standards are now developed (e.g. [ASTM F2924](https://www.astm.org/Standards/F2924.htm)) and certification organizations are developing [certification-procedures](http://www.lr.org/en/services/additive-manufacturing/additive-manufacturing-guidance-notes.aspx). \n\n## From a consumers perspective\nIn short term, the normal consumer will not feel much effect of the evolving technology. But in niche markets several end-user products is at the plateau of production like high-end HIFI equipment, high-end cycling equipment and glasses. All of these products take advantages of the complex design that 3D print makes possible, thus allowing more advanced products to end user markets than before.  At the same time, a lot of people might have already been flying in an Airbus with some of its vital [components](http://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/11948/First-Jet-Engines-with-3D-Printed-Nozzles-Delivered-to-Airbus.aspx) fabricated with 3D print. \n\n\n\n",

      "Description": "# Cloud Computing\nAsk someone on the street about a product of Microsoft and they will probably mention Windows or Office. Ask that same person about Amazon and they will probably say it’s an online bookstore or retailer. Not many people will tell you about Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS), even though these are the fastest growing products for both companies. Although not new, the concept of cloud computing is not easily grasped for people outside the ICT business, even though almost all of us are probably using it on a daily basis. \nIBM, an early innovator in cloud computing , describes it on their [website](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/learn-more/what-is-cloud-computing/) as follows “Cloud computing, often referred to as simply “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing resources — everything from applications to data centres — over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.”    \n\n## Location, Location, Location\nGenerally clouds are defined by what is in it and where it is located. To start with the last part, \nthere are three kinds of clouds: \n* A *public cloud* is a cloud solutions provide by a public company. Your application or data is hosted somewhere else and they will make sure that the hardware and applications will be stay up and running. Especially when you are not sure how many computing resources you will need in the future and it can fluctuate very quickly, the public cloud provides flexibility. \n* In a *private cloud* the end user also is relieved of some of most of the maintenance tasks, but this time the cloud itself is hosted by their own organisation on premises.  Especially for companies working with private or sensitive data. A private cloud must tackle a concern of privacy of the cloud.\n* A *hybrid cloud* is a combination of public and private cloud. Private data can still be stored in a private cloud, where non sensitive data and applications can move between a private and public cloud, depending on the need for resources. \n\nAccording to [Right Scale](http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-industry-insights/cloud-computing-trends-2017-state-cloud-survey), currently the hybrid cloud is still the most popular cloud option, but the adoption of the public is expected to grow faster. A North Bridge survey  showed that the spending on public cloud and is expected to account for 50% of all hardware, software and outsourcing services.   \n\n## Inside the cloud\nSo what is actually running inside a cloud? One of the most basic cloud services provides the user with hardware that they can completely manage themselves. They can install the operating system and the applications, the only thing that is provided is an infrastructure in the cloud. That is why this is called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). If you don’t want to manage the platform but want to run your own applications, cloud providers will offer you a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Sometimes even the software itself is already provided, these are Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud services. \n\n## Making it in the cloud\nGmail, Google Docs, Office 365 are among some of the more well-known and popular SaaS solutions, but many of the online services is used by developers and makers to share code, collaborate like GitHub and Slack but also to design or create like [Canva](https://about.canva.com/), etc. are all Software as a Service. They are popular among makers and developers as they often provide free use for small teams and projects or support open source initiatives. Many makers collaborating in online teams are living and making in the cloud. And you can leave it to the makers to maintain a list of free cloud offerings for developers.  \n\nThe flexibility of cloud computing is often the reason why start-ups are interested in cloud technologies. All big cloud  platforms support start-ups with attractive deals, hoping they will turn out to be the ‘next big thing’. At the same time the cloud services provide more and more additional services like data analytics, video streaming or machine learning. Services that were traditionally only available for large tech companies are now available for makers and start-ups to experiment with new concepts and products. Alexa Voice Service (AVS)   is recent example by Amazon which allows companies and makers to integrate the Natural Voice technology that powers the Amazon Echo in their own products. At GitHub  Amazon shares an example how to run  AVS on your own Raspberry Pi. \n\n",

      "Name": "All-in-one maker machines",
      "Description": "# All-in-one maker machines\n\nThe “All-in-one maker machines” are a combination of different digital fabrication tools in one machine. Normally\nthat device combine a 3D printer, a CNC milling machine and a laser cutter. CNC milling machines and 3D printers\nshare the same structure: their robotic head moves in the three axes X, Y and Z. This is guided by a microcontroller, an\nArduino, or any other computerized mechanical system.\n\nDespite these tools share a similar structure and technology, their technique of making is different. 3D printers use an\n\"additive manufacturing technique, which means they add material layer by layer to make a piece. On the other hand,\nCNC milling machines and laser cutters use a subtractive technique: from a piece of material they cut or scratch off\nthe extra material to make the final piece.\n\nThat makes it possible to have a three axis structure with a changeable head tool and switch between one tool or\ntechnique an another. In an industrial level, this have been possible for years now and there are machines with even\n200 different interchangeable tool. On the final consumer level, this is a new trend and it's hard to find an all-in-one\nmaker machine that has a nice quality and it's low-cost.\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/allinone1.png\" style=\"width:300px; margin:10px\"/>\n\n## All-in-one in the market\nAs commented before, multipurpose machines are common in the industry but in a los-cost level the available range of devices I limited. Most of them are in a price range starting from 500€, in kickstarter projects for example, to 3500€, for the most advanced like the ones that can even print with biological materials. The table below shows the best all-in-one maker machines in 2017 compiled by the by the 3D printing specialist website [all3dp.com](http://www.all3dp.com). \n\n## All that glitters is not gold\nAfter talking with experienced makers, the thread or downside of these kind of machines is that they are not that\nprecise. That means that a “traditional” 3D printer, laser cutter or CNC milling machine can achieve neater final\nresults, for instance: clean cuts, high definition printings or objects, etc. That makes high quality final products ready\nto sell.\nOn the other hand, the all-in-one maker machines offers three, four or five different tools or techniques, but, as they\nare a new trend still under development, the quality of the combined tools is not as high as the quality of the\n“traditional” separated tools. That makes the all-in-one maker machines perfect for prototyping, for students or\namateur projects, but not that good to make a final product ready for the market.\n\n## All-in-one machines for makers\nAs stated, all-in-one machines can be useful for makers but probably not in all the cases. These\nmachines are good for prototyping and also for maker educational programs in primary and secondary schools,\nuniversities and post-graduate schools. They can be useful for individual citizens and early adopters that want to test\nand support this new technology. But at the final consumer level, these kind of devices are still expensive and not\nproducing high quality products to sell in the market. So it we can tell that they will be really valuable for makers in some\nyears, when the technology and the options are more developed.\n",

      "Name": "Robotics and robot arms",
      "Description": "# Robotics and robot arms\n\nRobots, robot arm and robotics comes in many shapes and sizes. Applications range from pick and place in production facilities over toys to domestic tasks. Some are very simple in shape and function and in recent years, even advanced robot arms with several axis (bends or rotation) has become very easy to install with motion recordings.\n\nRobots have been around for many years and in the past few years development pace have increased a lot together with Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Author of the book, [Rise of the robots](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Robots-Technology-Threat-Jobless/dp/0465097537), Martin Ford, predicts that, in Amerika only, millions of low wage jobs is replaced by robots and especially the fast food industry will be soon to implement the new technology, where robots will not only deliver the food but also make it.\n\n## Helping out or overtaking\nThere is no doubt about that robots is changing the way factories of the future works, but could it also change the way we live our lives. We already see many automated processes in our home, freeing time for us to spend otherwise. In recent year robots has also entered as a part of the educational programme in Europe alongside with entrepreneurships, innovation and creativity. The robotics is useful as a tool to promote a different and experimental approach in learning even for young kids.\n\nMind controlled (neurally) robotics arms attached to a person’s amputated limb as a prosthetic – a bionic arm – is fairly new and not a finished product yet, but a handful of groups in U.S and Europa have come a long way. In the field of bionics arms, the development is closely followed in the Maker movement as well with among other projects the open source Open bionics.\n\n<img src=\"../img/details/robot1.jpg\" />\n\nOn the other hand, some predicts a dark future for humans when robots is developed to fulfil many of our existing jobs and outperform us. This is most likely to affect jobs like drivers, accountants, labours, and waiters.  Also at risk is [construction workers](http://www.construction-robotics.com/), [carers](http://medicalfuturist.com/robotics-healthcare/) and [soldiers](http://www.bostondynamics.com/). This could result in a lot of spare time for people in the future, but that might not be so fantastic according to Professor [Moshe Vardi](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-02/ru-wmc021016.php) and computer scientist [Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/18/robot-man-artificial-intelligence-computer-milky-way). \n\n## Makers make professional robot arms\nRobotic arms is, like any other technology, getting smart and cheaper by each day. This leads to robots handling tasks that are more advanced, but also smaller and simpler tasks - since buying the robot arm and installing it, is cheap and easy. It has become easy by programming it with e.g. motion recording (handhold teaching), easy-of-use software with 3D visualisation and self-learning / AI. Some projects making this happen comes from [maker communities](http://makezine.com/2015/09/18/robot-arms-you-can-buy-soon/) and start-ups.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both\">\n<img src=\"../img/details/robot2.jpg\" style=\"width:200px;margin:10px\"/><img src=\"../img/details/robot3.jpg\" style=\"width:200px;margin:10px\"/><img src=\"../img/details/robot4.jpg\" style=\"width:200px;margin:10px\"/>\n</div>\n\nSome of the robotic machines coming from the maker communities solves very simple tasks like alarming when mail is delivered and is mostly for fun etc. but others is perfected to be very precise, stabile and ease of use and at the same time is capable of working as a [multipurpose machine](http://makerarm.com/). Other makers collaborate and aim high in making an [open source self-driving car](https://www.udacity.com/self-driving-car). \n\n## Domestic robots\nFrom a consumer’s perspective by now, robotics have only affected the price on consumer goods, making them cheaper and in some places replaced several workers in the nearby factory. In the UK, [reports](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-02/ru-wmc021016.php) state that by 2035 1/10 jobs is replaced by [robots](https://www.adzuna.co.uk/blog/2017/01/27/drivers-and-receptionists-are-most-at-risk-from-losing-their-jobs-to-automation/)  and in 2050 about 50%.\n\nThe thought of having a robot in your home as a servant might not be appealing to everyone, but slowly robots will be become a part of our everyday lives. Already people use robot lawn mowers, vacuum cleaners, gutter cleaner, pool cleaners and coffee machines - that can serve you a drink that used to require a “skilled” barista. When technology that only used to be a part of a production facility finds more awareness in our minds and application in homes, it becomes more natural for us to interact with it. By now, it is not uncommon as a toy for children like a programmable teddy bear or an assembly kit with computer, actuators and sensors etc. like Lego Mindstorms among others (The online shop [www.robotshop.com](http://www.robotshop.com) has 117 products in the category Robot Toys.)\n\nFully self-driving or semi driving ([driver assistance systems](https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-driver-assistance-systems-534859)) cars, [bar mixing drinks](http://www.moley.com/) (but hey, all it does is pouring the liquids in the glass!) is already a reality and the future could easily bring fully [robotic kitchen help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYA2d35e-w8).\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xYA2d35e-w8?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Productions = Robot arms\nThere is no doubt that robots are going to have a huge impact already in the production facilities all over the world. Right now in Europe, we typically see that robots are making insourcing feasible again. While, for many years the “easy” way to gain profit in a society demanding cheaper products, was to outsource manufacturing to low wage countries around the world, it is now time for insourcing (except for Germany). Robots are an essential part of Industry 4.0 to ensure an intelligent, reliable but flexible production based on increased automatization and sophisticated robots.[more](https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/manufacturing/industry_4-0_robotics_presents_a_golden_opportunity/) \n\nIn enterprises, robots and humans will likely be working together by side in within a few years, opposed to now a day, where the robot is safely shielded of in a cage, and the process is stopped when a human is passing into the working area. This is a challenge for certification/standardisation bodies focusing on safety together with the developers of the robot arms.  \nMany SME’s right now see the benefits in robot taking over the dull monotone work but it’s still a challenge economically or [practically](http://www.gereports.com/post/107898198705/rethink-robotics-is-freeing-next-gen-robots-from/).  The enabler is robots getting smarter and [easier to install](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur-robot-benefits/), so production can keep running.\n",

In a world where bits are the new atoms industries getting digitized will encounter the exact same issues that the music industry had to face. It will become increasingly difficult to small players to reach sustainability when the maker of a design looses any type of control the second the design is shared. No matter if the maker wants to allow free access or sale his IP without a platform to manage Intellectual property makers are struggling to stay in control. This also reveals a need for makers to be sustainable to move from the hobby level to a professional one. Time horizon for technologies to emerge in this field is a bout [2 years](http://www.insidecounsel.com/2016/02/09/lets-look-closer-at-3d-printing-and-ip-issues?slreturn=1493415811). \n\nThe opportunity of using such platform to manage IPR is the possibility to become a sustainable business by selling IP rights and reaching many using a trusted environment. For example a blockchain powered Data right management platform could allow to keep full traceability of IPR for makers while enabling new business models to emerge.\n\nThe thread for makers and all industries disrupted by digitization is the huge loss of revenues or potential revenues linked to IP theft.
