{"results":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sculptris","label":"Sculptris","description":"Sculptris is the brainchild of programmer Tomas Pettersson, who developed as an unpaid hobby project and a work-in-progress sculpting tool since early December 2009. Users can pull, push, pinch, twist, and do just about anything that they could do with a regular piece of modeling clay. It is geared for character sculpting and \"organic\" models. 3D meshes can be imported into the program for further detailing, generating normal and displacement maps.","refCount":0,"classes":[{"uri":"http://schema.org/CreativeWork","label":"creative work"},{"uri":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","label":"owl#Thing"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Work","label":"work"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Software","label":"software"}],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:3D_graphics_software","label":"3D graphics software"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2009_software","label":"2009 software"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]}]}
