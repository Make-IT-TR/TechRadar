Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.","refCount":987,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Vector_spaces","label":"Vector spaces"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Linear_algebra","label":"Linear algebra"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fundamental_physics_concepts","label":"Fundamental physics concepts"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Abstract_algebra","label":"Abstract algebra"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mathematical_structures","label":"Mathematical structures"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Vectors","label":"Vectors"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Group_theory","label":"Group theory"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dimension","label":"Dimension","description":"In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it.
