{"results":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinematics","label":"Kinematics","description":"Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects) and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without consideration of the forces that cause it. The term is the English version of A.M. Ampère's cinématique, which he constructed from the Greek κίνημα, kinema (movement, motion), derived from κινεῖν, kinein (to move). The study of kinematics is often referred to as the geometry of motion. (See analytical dynamics for more detail on usage).","refCount":243,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Kinematics","label":"Kinematics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Classical_mechanics","label":"Classical mechanics"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rigid_body","label":"Rigid body","description":"In physics, a rigid body is an idealization of a solid body of finite size in which deformation is neglected. In other words, the distance between any two given points of a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces exerted on it. Even though such an object cannot physically exist due to relativity, objects can normally be assumed to be perfectly rigid if they are not moving near the speed of light.","refCount":102,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Introductory_physics","label":"Introductory physics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rigid_bodies","label":"Rigid bodies"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rotational_symmetry","label":"Rotational symmetry"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inverse_kinematics","label":"Inverse kinematics","description":"Inverse kinematics refers to the use of the kinematics equations of a robot to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired position of the end-effector. Specification of the movement of a robot so that its end-effector achieves a desired task is known as motion planning. Inverse kinematics transforms the motion plan into joint actuator trajectories for the robot.","refCount":42,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Virtual_reality","label":"Virtual reality"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Computational_physics","label":"Computational physics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Inverse_problems","label":"Inverse problems"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:3D_computer_graphics","label":"3D computer graphics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Robot_kinematics","label":"Robot kinematics"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stellar_kinematics","label":"Stellar kinematics","description":"Stellar kinematics is the study of the movement of stars without needing to understand how they acquired their motion. This differs from stellar dynamics, which takes into account gravitational effects. The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. In astronomy, it is widely accepted that most stars are born within molecular clouds known as stellar nurseries.","refCount":24,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Stellar_astronomy","label":"Stellar astronomy"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Moving_groups","label":"Moving groups"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Galactic_astronomy","label":"Galactic astronomy"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Stellar_associations","label":"Stellar associations"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinetics_(physics)","label":"Kinetics (physics)","description":"In physics and engineering, kinetics is a term for the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the relationship between the motion of bodies and its causes, namely forces and torques. Since the mid-20th century, the term \"dynamics\" (or \"analytical dynamics\") has largely superseded \"kinetics\" in physics text books; the term \"kinetics\" is still used in engineering. In mechanics, the Kinetics is deduced from Kinematics by the introduction of the concept of mass.","refCount":20,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Kinetics","label":"Kinetics"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]}]}
