{"results":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drawing","label":"Drawing","description":"Drawing is a form of visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium. Common instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals. An artist who practices or works in drawing may be called a draftsman or draughtsman. A small amount of material is released onto the two dimensional medium, leaving a visible mark.","refCount":1051,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drawing","label":"Drawing"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","label":"Force","description":"In physics, a force is any influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical construction. In other words, a force is that which can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e. , to accelerate, or which can cause a flexible object to deform. Force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or pull.","refCount":808,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fundamental_physics_concepts","label":"Fundamental physics concepts"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Physical_quantities","label":"Physical quantities"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Force","label":"Force"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Natural_philosophy","label":"Natural philosophy"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Classical_mechanics","label":"Classical mechanics"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duel","label":"Duel","description":"A duel generally signifies an arranged engagement in combat between two individuals, with matched weapons in accordance with agreed-upon rules. Duels in this form were chiefly practised in Early Modern Europe, with precedents in the medieval code of chivalry, and continued into the modern period (19th to early 20th centuries) especially among military officers.","refCount":724,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dueling","label":"Dueling"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Water_well","label":"Water well","description":"A water well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, boring or drilling to access groundwater in underground aquifers. The well water is drawn by an electric submersible pump, a trash pump, a vertical turbine pump, a handpump or a mechanical pump (e.g. from a water-pumping windmill). It can also be drawn up using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Wells can vary greatly in depth, water volume and water quality.","refCount":718,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Archaeological_features","label":"Archaeological features"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Water_supply_infrastructure","label":"Water supply infrastructure"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Water_wells","label":"Water wells"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiln","label":"Kiln","description":"A kiln is a thermally insulated chamber, or oven, in which a controlled temperature regime is produced.
