{"results":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ground_state","label":"Ground state","description":"The ground state of a quantum mechanical system is its lowest-energy state; the energy of the ground state is known as the zero-point energy of the system. An excited state is any state with energy greater than the ground state. The ground state of a quantum field theory is usually called the vacuum state or the vacuum. If more than one ground state exists, they are said to be degenerate. Many systems have degenerate ground states.","refCount":239,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_mechanics","label":"Quantum mechanics"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hartle–Hawking_state","label":"Hartle–Hawking state","description":null,"refCount":18,"classes":[],"categories":[],"templates":[],"redirects":[]}]}
