{"results":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass_razoo","label":"Brass razoo","description":"Brass razoo is an Australian phrase that was first recorded in soldiers' slang in World War I. It is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"a non-existent coin of trivial value\". It is commonly used in the expression I haven't got a brass razoo, meaning the speaker is out of money. Whilst mock coins of 1 Razoo are popular (see photograph), no actual monetary unit has ever been so named. Some speculate that the term arises from Egyptian or Indian currency.","refCount":3,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Slang","label":"Slang"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:New_Zealand_English","label":"New Zealand English"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Australian_English","label":"Australian English"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fictional_currencies","label":"Fictional currencies"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]}]}
