The individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries. An example of a matrix with six elements is Matrices of the same size can be added or subtracted element by element. The rule for matrix multiplication is more complicated, and two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second.","refCount":1043,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Matrices","label":"Matrices"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uterus","label":"Uterus","description":"The uterus (from Latin \"uterus\", plural uteri or \"uteruses\") or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals including humans. One end, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes, depending on the species. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation, usually developing completely in placental mammals such as humans and partially in marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums.","refCount":944,"classes":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AnatomicalStructure","label":"anatomical structure"},{"uri":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","label":"owl#Thing"}],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Pelvis","label":"Pelvis"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Organs","label":"Organs"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Female_reproductive_system","label":"Female reproductive system"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Materials_science","label":"Materials science","description":"Materials science is an interdisciplinary field applying the properties of matter to various areas of science and engineering.
