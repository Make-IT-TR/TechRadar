{"results":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laser","label":"Laser","description":"A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of photons. The term \"laser\" originated as an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The emitted laser light is notable for its high degree of spatial and temporal coherence, unattainable using other technologies. Spatial coherence typically is expressed through the output being a narrow beam which is diffraction-limited, often a so-called \"pencil beam.","refCount":1997,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_inventions","label":"American inventions"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Forensic_equipment","label":"Forensic equipment"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Photonics","label":"Photonics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Orphan_initialisms","label":"Orphan initialisms"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Quantum_optics","label":"Quantum optics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Acronyms","label":"Acronyms"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Directed-energy_weapons","label":"Directed-energy weapons"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lasers","label":"Lasers"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transistor","label":"Transistor","description":"A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and power. It is composed of a semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals changes the current flowing through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal.","refCount":965,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1947_introductions","label":"1947 introductions"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_inventions","label":"American inventions"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Transistors","label":"Transistors"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Semiconductor_devices","label":"Semiconductor devices"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spectroscopy","label":"Spectroscopy","description":"Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and radiated energy. Historically, spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, e.g. , by a prism. Later the concept was expanded greatly to comprise any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency. Spectroscopic data is often represented by a spectrum, a plot of the response of interest as a function of wavelength or frequency.","refCount":932,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Observational_astronomy","label":"Observational astronomy"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Spectroscopy","label":"Spectroscopy"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Scattering","label":"Scattering"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laserdisc","label":"Laserdisc","description":"LaserDisc (LD) is a home video format and the first commercial optical disc storage medium.
