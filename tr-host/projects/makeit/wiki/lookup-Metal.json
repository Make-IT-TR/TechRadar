With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.","refCount":7942,"classes":[{"uri":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","label":"owl#Thing"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MusicGenre","label":"music genre"}],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rock_music","label":"Rock music"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_styles_of_music","label":"American styles of music"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:European_music","label":"European music"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rock_music_genres","label":"Rock music genres"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Heavy_metal","label":"Heavy metal"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aluminium","label":"Aluminium","description":"Aluminium or aluminum is a silvery white member of the boron group of chemical elements. It has the symbol Al, and its atomic number is 13. It is not soluble in water under normal circumstances. Aluminium is the third most abundant element, and the most abundant metal, in the Earth's crust. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface. Aluminium metal is too reactive chemically to occur natively. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals.","refCount":4403,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rocket_fuels","label":"Rocket fuels"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Aluminium","label":"Aluminium"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Reducing_agents","label":"Reducing agents"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Pyrotechnic_fuels","label":"Pyrotechnic fuels"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Chemical_elements","label":"Chemical elements"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Poor_metals","label":"Poor metals"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Electrical_conductors","label":"Electrical conductors"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Airship_technology","label":"Airship technology"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Post-transition_metals","label":"Post-transition metals"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_metal","label":"Death metal","description":"Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes. Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid 1980s. Metal acts such as Slayer, Kreator, Celtic Frost, and Venom were very important influences to the crafting of the genre.","refCount":2305,"classes":[{"uri":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","label":"owl#Thing"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MusicGenre","label":"music genre"}],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Death_metal","label":"Death metal"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Heavy_metal_subgenres","label":"Heavy metal subgenres"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metal","label":"Metal","description":"A metal (from Greek \"μέταλλον\" – métallon, \"mine, quarry, metal\") is an element, compound, or alloy that is a good conductor of both electricity and heat. Metals are usually malleable and shiny, that is they reflect most of incident light. In a metal, atoms readily lose electrons to form positive ions. Those ions are surrounded by de-localized electrons, which are responsible for the conductivity.","refCount":2234,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Metallic_elements","label":"Metallic elements"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Article_Feedback_5","label":"Article Feedback 5"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Metals","label":"Metals"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Greek_loanwords","label":"Greek loanwords"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_metal","label":"Black metal","description":"Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, raw recording, and unconventional song structures.
