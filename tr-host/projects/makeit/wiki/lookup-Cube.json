This distance r is known as the \"radius\" of the sphere. The maximum straight distance through the sphere is known as the \"diameter\" of the sphere.","refCount":987,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Surfaces","label":"Surfaces"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Elementary_shapes","label":"Elementary shapes"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Spheres","label":"Spheres"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Topology","label":"Topology"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Differential_topology","label":"Differential topology"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Greek_loanwords","label":"Greek loanwords"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Elementary_geometry","label":"Elementary geometry"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Differential_geometry","label":"Differential geometry"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Homogeneous_spaces","label":"Homogeneous spaces"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Famitsu","label":"Famitsu","description":"Famitsu is a line of Japanese video game magazines published by Enterbrain, Inc. and Tokuma.
