The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modelling. Mathematical models are used not only in the natural sciences and engineering disciplines, but also in the social sciences; physicists, engineers, statisticians, operations research analysts and economists use mathematical models most extensively.","refCount":544,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Applied_mathematics","label":"Applied mathematics"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Knowledge_representation","label":"Knowledge representation"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mathematical_terminology","label":"Mathematical terminology"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mathematical_modeling","label":"Mathematical modeling"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Conceptual_models","label":"Conceptual models"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Collective_intelligence","label":"Collective intelligence"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graph_(mathematics)","label":"Graph (mathematics)","description":"In mathematics, a graph is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics.","refCount":530,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Graph_theory_objects","label":"Graph theory objects"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Graph_theory","label":"Graph theory"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dyscalculia","label":"Dyscalculia","description":"Dyscalculia (or maths disability) is a specific learning disability involving innate difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic. It is akin to dyslexia and includes difficulty in understanding numbers, learning how to manipulate numbers, learning maths facts, and a number of other related symptoms (although there is no exact form of the disability).","refCount":47,"classes":[{"uri":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","label":"owl#Thing"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease","label":"disease"}],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Neurological_disorders","label":"Neurological disorders"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Special_education","label":"Special education"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dyslexia","label":"Dyslexia"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mathematical_model_of_the_guitar","label":"Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematical model of the guitar","description":null,"refCount":1,"classes":[],"categories":[],"templates":[],"redirects":[]},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Polytechnic_Institute_College_of_Engineering_and_Physical-Mathematic_Sciences","label":"National Polytechnic Institute College of Engineering and Physical-Mathematic Sciences","description":"The College of Engineering and Physical-Mathematic Sciences of the National Polytechnic Institute is a highly recognized institute of higher education in Mexico. The College was proposed in 1932 by Secretary of Public Education Narciso Bassols and was founded by integrating the already existent School of Mecanichal and Electrical Sciences that dates back to the 19th century. Currently the College is divided in six schools.","refCount":0,"classes":[],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:National_Polytechnic_Institute","label":"National Polytechnic Institute"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]}]}
