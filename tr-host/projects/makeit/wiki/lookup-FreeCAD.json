FreeCAD is aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture or other engineering specialties. FreeCAD features tools similar to CATIA, SolidWorks or Solid Edge, and therefore also falls into the category of MCAD, PLM, CAx and CAE.","refCount":3,"classes":[{"uri":"http://schema.org/CreativeWork","label":"creative work"},{"uri":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","label":"owl#Thing"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Work","label":"work"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Software","label":"software"}],"categories":[{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Free_software_programmed_in_Python","label":"Free software programmed in Python"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Windows_software","label":"Windows software"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Unix_computer-aided_design_software","label":"Unix computer-aided design software"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Free_computer-aided_design_software","label":"Free computer-aided design software"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Software_that_uses_Qt","label":"Software that uses Qt"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Linux_computer-aided_design_software","label":"Linux computer-aided design software"},{"uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Free_software_programmed_in_C++","label":"Free software programmed in C++"}],"templates":[],"redirects":[]}]}
