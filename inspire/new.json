These objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced from a 3D model or other electronic data source. A 3D printer is a type of industrial robot. Futurologists such as Jeremy Rifkin believe that 3D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution, succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century. Using the power of the Internet, it may eventually be possible to send a blueprint of any product to any place in the world to be replicated by a 3D printer with \"elemental inks\" capable of being combined into any material substance of any desired form. 3D printing in the term's original sense refers to processes that sequentially deposit material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads. More recently, the meaning of the term has expanded to encompass a wider variety of techniques such as extrusion and sintering-based processes. Technical standards generally use the term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.",

However, sometimes the production depends on further processes in additional machines, which in total does not fit the desktop anymore. This size of machines is available for most digital tools for manufacturing like 3D printing, Laser cutting and CNC routing. \r\n\r\nFor some makers and enterprises the ideal machine is reliable and cannot be fiddled with, a so-called out-of-the-box machine (3D printers like UP3D UP Plus 2 and CraftUnique CraftBot – see picture below) and for others, it needs to be completely open and adjustable in any way – even by building it themselves like the RepRap. This printer is a low \r\n\r\nbudget project for the real hardware-software enthusiast. The idea is to make a machine that can reproduce itself. All brackets and joints have been printed with another 3D-printer. It comes in many shapes and sizes. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"../img/details/desktop1.jpg\" style=\"width:80%\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"../img/details/desktop2.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n## Gap is closing in the years to come \r\nThe gap between more expensive machines for manufacturing and cheaper desktop models is closing. Part quality regarding surface finish, mechanical properties, resolution and reliability of the printer is equal to many of the bigger and professional machines within many technologies like laser cutters and 3D printers like FDM and SLA technologies. “In the next year or so, competition between desktop 3D printers and industrial systems will increase as the capabilities of the desktop systems continue to grow”5 E.g. we already see printers in this market with features to recognise the material and adjust the print settings automatically. \r\n\r\nThe key enabler for making these machines attractive for makers and small enterprises is the low price range compared to larger and more professional systems. Even though the technology is not on the same level, in many cases it does not justify the 90 times higher price on professional systems.6  \r\n\r\nAnother advantage making these machines attractive for enterprises is the wide range of materials available on the market. With the number of machines manufacturers exploding the recent years, so is material manufacturers. For the “open” desktop 3D printers, material is actually available that is not yet available for the “closed” professional machines, e.g. soft TPU, metal filled, metal clay, conductive and biodegradable filament. In Wholers report Joris Peels estimate that filament developers and manufacturers could drive the desktop market growth, as they develop material the industrial end users needs. \r\n\r\n## Known technology will be cheap and at desktop size \r\nStratasys’ patent on FDM printing opened in 2009 and since then the market have flooded with FDM-printers. Just recently, the patents on Laser sintering (SLS) and Stereolithography (SLA) opened, so these technologies will soon be available on “low budget”. \r\n\r\nThis SLS technology is widely used in the enterprise market (print services). These is due to good mechanical properties of the parts. The downside is poor surface roughness due to powder materials. The powder material causes an issue with material handling, when it comes to makers and consumers, as it needs to be handled with personal protection equipment. These machines are already available in desktop size but the price is not below 5000 Euro yet, though this is expected to happen within five years or so. \r\n\r\nPlastic printers will be more reliable, have slightly better detail and finish, but will also print in several materials in one printer. The materials will be more advances, making it possible to print electrical circuits and combine the materials e.g. rubber-like and rigid plastic. Few machines already have the ability to print a continuous fibre reinforcement into the print, increasing the strength and stiffness several times, addressing the issue with poor mechanical properties in FDM parts. This is likely to pick up, when consumers adapt to the technology and find more \r\n\r\napplications to this. When more technologies have accessed the consumer market, new exciting materials will follow e.g. Metals and ceramics in liquid SLA material.7 \r\n\r\nIn approximately five years, ongoing projects about extruding metals with a desktop printer will be finished. June 2016 a metal printer (aluminium) with droplets had its debut. In the beginning, this will only be available for the enterprise. Other projects related to this, e.g. using electroplating techniques for printing will also be close to market techniques for printing will also be close to market. \r\n\r\n## Machines are getting smaller and smarter \r\nBetter, cheaper and more reliable machines will make digital manufacturing more popular in general in all markets; maker, consumer and enterprise. This will accelerate product development8 and lead to greater mass customisation and distributed manufacturing \r\n\r\nThis could eventually lead to more home manufacturing and thus to more “makers”. Later on, these makers will be “ordinary” end users - without the thinking of maker movement but home manufacturing could be as natural as shopping (you shop online and print it yourself). \r\n\r\nTechnologies for 3D-printing which will access the market for makers in few years, like SLA and Poly-jetting (both light polymerization) is now suitable for enterprises. In order to prepare it for hobbyist, issues about material handling must be taken care of. Very fine powder from the SLS and the toxic epoxy liquid from SLA can cause health damage if it is not suitable handled. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"../img/details/desktop2.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n## From a makers perspective\r\nThe increase in numbers of cheap FDM printers, laser cutters and even CNC routers on the market have facilitated huge growth in the maker movement. More technologies that are available, opening up to an even wider range of materials (different surface finishes and mechanical properties) and new design freedom will lead to continues exponential growth9 in the maker movement. \r\n\r\nWhen all these machines becomes better and smarter and one does not need to be a real “tinkerer” or even have technical insight. \r\n\r\n## From a consumer perspective\r\nFor every day consumers the machine will only be useful when it is completely reliable and only the material needs to be refilled. By now, it is completely applicable in homes for making small gadgets with very easy to use machines. When it comes to ease of use machines, the collaboration between Microsoft and MakerBot10 serves a good example on how machines for home manufacturing will soon be “plug and print”, as we are all used to when printing out a document.  \r\n\r\nOne way, this user group is already in contact with the new technology, is through educational systems. One of the largest markets for desktop machines is believed to be in educational institutions.11 3D-printing and other digital tools for manufacturing is already a permanent piece of equipment in the workshop at some public schools and most \r\n\r\nschools for higher education. Here it facilitates better understanding and acquire skills when teaching STEM12 13 (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics). \r\n\r\nEventually this will also lead to more advanced parts in every home. \r\n\r\n## From an enterprise perspective \r\nThis will accelerate with designers increased awareness of the new possibilities with digital tooling – facilitated by. \r\n\r\nEven though it is believed that hundreds of companies produce desktop 3d-printers in this low price range, the majority ends up in enterprises, perhaps as many as 65-75%. Engineering departments and designers have been the largest users.14 Like stated before, this will speed up the pace which products are being developed when small manufacturing machines is wide spread in all engineering departments 15 and make products better and smart with the bigger freedom of design that comes with digital tools for manufacturing. Even though the small desktop machines technology wise will still lag behind larger professional machines at the current time, this trend will by time facilitate, that designers and engineers, will design each product smarter (e.g. more efficient or have tweaked mechanical properties like damping) and consist of fewer parts. E.g. vital and compact parts in high performance applications like turbine engines.16 ",
