                The interactive <strong>Technology Radar</strong> (also called <strong>TechRadar</strong>) describes future technology developments or trends that will impact how makers will create, communicate, organize and might even do business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its purpose is to provide state-of-the-art overviews of both: 1) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and related applications developed and/or used by The results of this research will help to understand the uses and impacts of <strong>CAPS</strong> in different contexts, as well as of the Maker movement itself., and 2) maker technology developed and/or used by makers. This will include the relationships and mutual complementary of the two. In this way, it developes forward scenarios and a watching brief of these two technology areas and how they are used by The results of this research will help to understand the uses and impacts of <strong>CAPS</strong> in different contexts, as well as of the Maker movement itself. and maker communities both respectively and in combination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>TechRadar</strong> consists of 3 sections:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <em>Trends</em> page contains a list of all the trends currently available in the radar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Platforms</em> page allows users to navigate and search the available platforms within the radar. Typical situations for using this part of the website would be when a maker is looking for suggestions for team collaboration tools or wants to explore what kind of funding possibilities are available. The <em>Platforms</em> page also contains a button to invite visitors to add new content. A new page will open with a simple form to suggest a new platform to the radar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Radar</em> page is a visual presentation based on the categorisations and dimension scores presented in the other two sections. It is here fully interactive, it enables users to group (filter) by category, a certain score, etc., and thereby change the layout of it.In the settings menu, the user can add or change filters e.g. only show the technologies that are being used by innovators or from one technology category. The settings menu can be used to change which dimensions will be used on each axis, for the size and colour. Updating these settings is directly reflected in the radar and in the legends underneath the settings. When a dimension is chosen in the filter settings, the legends specify what size and colour each stage or rating is given.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It has been a deliberate decision to use as many open source components as possible for the implementation of the website. At the same time is the technical implementation of the website is also available as a public repository on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Make-IT-TR/TechRadar">https://github.com/Make-IT-TR/TechRadar</a>. It uses the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT Licence</a> making it available for other to use and/or enhance where possible. The issues section of the repository will also be used as a collaboration tool to discuss future work.

              The <strong>TechRadar</strong> has been developed within <strong>MAKE-IT</strong>, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a> European research project focused on how the role of <strong>Collective Awareness Platforms (CAPS)</strong> enables the growth and governance of the <strong>Maker movement</strong>, particularly in relation to Information Technology, using and creating <em>social innovations</em> and achieving <em>sustainability</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
              To understand how the role and impact of <strong>CAPS</strong> approaches the Maker movement, <strong>MAKE-IT</strong> undertakes multidisciplinary research in different fields including: behavioural studies, social psychology, sociology, management information systems, economics, environmental science, technological impact and governance issues. The results of this research will help to understand the uses and impacts of <strong>CAPS</strong> in different contexts, as well as of the Maker movement itself. <strong>MAKE-IT</strong> will focus the research specifically on the role of <strong>CAPS</strong> in:

                  what maker participants do and how they behave;

              <li>
                  the various ways this impacts on and adds value to society.
