          The existing list of trends is based on desk research combined with discussions among partners with their different technological expertise in the elds of manufacturing, ICT and CAPS. In task 5.1 market studies4, interviews with makers and
          investigating the use and popularity of different online platforms have been used to identify major technology categories. The challenge of WP 5.2 was to bring that back to a limited set of trends that are applicable to wide range of technologies.</p>
        <p>
          The first long list of trends were quickly shortened based on the following criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The developments should be applicable to a wide range of makers.</strong>
            Some technological enhancements might only impact a speci c domain, while the impact for other makers will be minimal. For example, sharing economy that is disrupting a lot of conventional businesses in society like ownership / rental of cars and
            other goods, transportation (Uber) and hotel industries (Airbnb) but might not impact the larger maker industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The developments should be practical in the next 5 years.</strong>
            Some fundamental technology research, like nanobots or quantum computing, could be promising on the long term, but not be available for makers within a reasonable timeframe.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the Technology Radar the trends are described by the following aspects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Related technologies:</strong>
            Trends in the Technology Radar will most often relate to multiple technologies. The trend towards Desktop manufacturing for example will need enhancements in manufacturing hardware, but also requires more accessible 3D modelling tools and 3D model
            sharing platforms. Using the existing dimensions, the technology radar can visualise how these technologies will change over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In Products and Platforms:</strong>
            These are examples of existing products and platforms related to the technologies for a speci c trend. Most often these are the products to follow for innovations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Roadmap:</strong>
            Technologies are evolving within their own timeframe. To describe these changes, we focus on roughly two time periods: soon (within 2 years) and later (within 5 years)
